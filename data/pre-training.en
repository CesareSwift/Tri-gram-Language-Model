##resumption of the session###i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 00 december 0000 and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.###although as you will have seen the dreaded millennium bug failed to materialise still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.###you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this partsession.###in the meantime i should like to observe a minute s silence as a number of members have requested on behalf of all the victims concerned particularly those of the terrible storms in the various countries of the european union.###please rise then for this minute s silence.###the house rose and observed a minute s silence###madam president on a point of order.###you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka.###one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago.###would it be appropriate for you madam president to write a letter to the sri lankan president expressing parliaments regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation.###yes mr evans i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.###if the house agrees i shall do as mr evans has suggested.###madam president on a point of order.###i would like your advice about rule 000 concerning inadmissibility.###my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again.###the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 0 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.###it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.###i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.###i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report not a legislative proposal and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday.###that is precisely the time when you may if you wish raise this question i.e. on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.###madam president coinciding with this year s first partsession of the european parliament a date has been set unfortunately for next thursday in texas in america for the execution of a young 00 yearold man who has been sentenced to death.###we shall call him mr hicks.###at the request of a french member mr zimeray a petition has already been presented which many people signed including myself.###however i would ask you in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community to make representations using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent to the president and to the governor of texas mr bush who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.###this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.###thank you mr segni i shall do so gladly.###indeed it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted.###madam president i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest.###it is the case of alexander nikitin.###all of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in russia too access to environmental information is a constitutional right.###now however he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.###we know and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed including specifically during the last plenary partsession of last year that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for alexander nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.###these findings form the basis of the european programmes to protect the barents sea and that is why i would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make parliaments position as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted clear as far as russia is concerned.###yes mrs schroedter i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter.###madam president i would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that during this first partsession of the new year the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.###but madam president my personal request has not been met.###although there are now two finnish channels and one portuguese one there is still no dutch channel which is what i had requested because dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.###i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well.###mrs plooijvan gorsel i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors meeting on wednesday.###it will i hope be examined in a positive light.###madam president can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes.###why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected.###why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 0000.###why has there been no fire drill either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings.###why are there no fire instructions.###why have the staircases not been improved since my accident.###why are nosmoking areas not enforced.###it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.###mrs lynne you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done.###i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestors and i am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.###madam president mrs dez gonzlez and i had tabled questions on certain opinions of the vicepresident mrs de palacio which appeared in a spanish newspaper.###the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous partsession.###i would ask that they reconsider since this is not the case.###the questions answered previously referred to mrs de palacio s intervention on another occasion and not to these comments which appeared in the abc newspaper on 00 november.###mr berenguer fuster we shall check all this.###i admit that at present the matter seems to be somewhat confused.###we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.###madam president i should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from parliament this week about our discontent over todays decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia considering that the vast majority in this parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past.###todays decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.###so parliament should send a message since that is the wish of the vast majority.###it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo.###as people have said the situation there is extremely volatile.###there is in fact a risk of a military coup in the future.###we do not know what is happening.###so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people.###in any event this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday.###agenda###the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 00 january pursuant to rule 000 of the rules of procedure.###no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday.###relating to wednesday###the group of the party of european socialists requests that a commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the commission.###i would like mr barn crespo who made the request to speak to propose it.###that is if he so wishes of course.###then we shall follow the usual procedure hearing one speaker in favour and one against.###madam president the presentation of the prodi commission s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the group of the party of european socialists which was unanimously approved by the conference of presidents in september and which was also explicitly accepted by president prodi who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.###this commitment is important because the commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaties and therefore basically dictates this parliament s political and legislative activity for the next five years.###i would also like to point out madam president that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature.###it did so again during this legislature in july and then in september it voted once more to approve the whole commission.###there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.###to this end i would like to remind you of the resolution of 00 september which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.###the events of last week  which originated outside the conference of presidents that conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere  present us with a dilemma.###either the commission is not ready to present this programme in which case it should clarify it.###according to its president it is in a position to do so.###given that the commission is represented by vicepresident de palacio i believe that before voting it would help if the commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme as agreed.###alternatively parliament is not ready to examine this programme as some appear to be suggesting.###in my opinion this second hypothesis would imply the failure of parliament in its duty as a parliament as well as introducing an original thesis an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware in writing of a speech concerning the commission s programme a week earlier  and not a day earlier as had been agreed  bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in february so we could forego the debate since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the internet and parliament will no longer have to worry about it.###my group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen debate and reflect there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that if the commission is ready to do so we still have time to reestablish the original agreement between parliament and the commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.###therefore the proposal of the group of the party of european socialists and which you have mentioned is that the prodi commission present its legislative programme on wednesday including its proposed administrative reform because otherwise we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation on the pretext that there is no text on the one hand the president of the commission would be denied his right to speak in this parliament and on the other hand there would be a debate on a reform when parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.###therefore madam president i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.###applause from the pse group###madam president i really am quite astonished at mr barn crespo s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on wednesdays agenda.###mr barn crespo you were unable to attend the conference of presidents last thursday.###i am not criticising this it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them.###mr hnsch represented you on this occasion.###in the conference of presidents we had an indepth discussion.###your group was alone in advocating what you are saying now.###we then put it to a vote.###as you know each chairman has the same number of votes as his group has members.###there was a vote on this matter.###as i recall the outcome of this vote was 000 votes to 000 with a few abstentions.###this means that all the groups with the exception of the nonattached members  but of course they are not a group  were in agreement only your group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here.###all of the others were of a different opinion.###that was the decision.###i should now like to comment on the issue itself.###we have confidence in the commission and in romano prodi and after a difficult procedure as everyone knows the vast majority of our group supported the vote of confidence in romano prodi and the commission.###we believe however that the commissions strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the european parliament but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the commission and which describes this programme over the fiveyear period.###there is no such document.###the commission will present its programme for the year 0000 in february.###we have said very well if the commission does not wish to introduce the 0000 programme as early as january then we will do it in february.###we have agreed to this.###after all we do not wish to quarrel with the commission if at all possible we believe that the commission and parliament need to tread the same path.###however we in parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the commission.###i should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the fiveyear programme in our groups.###you cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this house and have no idea of its content.###that is why we would recommend  and it is my impression that the commission is also open to this idea  that we hold the debate on the commissions longterm programme up to the year 0000 in february  and i hope that the commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us  and that at the same time in february we also hold the debate on the commissions legislative programme for the year 0000.###the fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together.###that is why my group firmly rejects the proposal made by the socialist group.###applause from the ppede group###madam president i would like to make it very clear that above all the commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this parliament and amongst those the decision establishing its agenda.###we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide.###but i would also like to make it very clear that president prodi made a commitment to this parliament to introduce a new debate as mr barn crespo has reminded us which would be in addition to the annual debate on the commission s legislative programme on the broad areas of action for the next five years that is to say for this legislature.###madam president i would like to say that the agreement reached in september distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the commission s legislative programme.###i would also like to say that the commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.###therefore madam president i would like to repeat that the commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and when parliament decides  this week if that is the decision  we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and next month the programme for 0000 which is what we fully agreed upon.###i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.###parliament rejected the request president.###still on the subject of wednesday s sitting i have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.###the ppede group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.###is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this.###madam president i can hear a ripple of laughter from the socialists.###i was told that large sections of the socialist group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda because at the vote in the conference of presidents no vote was received from the working group of members of the socialist group responsible for this matter.###i do not know whether this information is correct but the ppede group would in any case be grateful if this item were removed because parliament has addressed this issue several times already.###decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.###that is why my group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.###thank you mr poettering.###we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request.###madam president i would firstly like to point out mr poettering s lack of logic.###he has just been preaching to the group of the party of european socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the conference of presidents and now he is doing just the same.###we discussed that matter and we were unanimous with the exception of the ppe and eldr groups.###as my fellow chairmen will recall i even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the tobin tax but of whether one dared to hear what the commission and the council thought of it.###it is not a lot to ask.###i therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the commission and the council should be retained so that we can find out once and for all the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the seattle conference.###we shall proceed to vote on the ppede group s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.###parliament rejected the request with 000 votes for 000 votes against and 0 abstentions###madam president i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate.###thank you very much.###madam president has my vote been counted.###i was unable to vote electronically since i do not have a card.###my vote was in favour .###indeed if we add the two members who have declared themselves then the result of the vote would be ....###madam president the presidency has already declared the result of the vote.###there is no room for amendments.###ladies and gentlemen once again we see it is essential for members to bring their voting cards along on a monday.###clearly there is a problem here.###that being the case i shall have to make a decision.###i too forgot my card and i would have voted against.###i therefore consider that the oral question may be kept on the agenda as per the vote.###this is the last time that we shall make allowances for members who have forgotten their cards.###let that be clearly noted and understood.###applausethe oral question will therefore remain on the agenda and yes your president is entitled to vote just as she is entitled to forget her voting card.###we shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda.###madam president in the earlier vote  and i will abide by your ruling on this matter  on the question of the strategic plan of the commission i indicated that i would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my group.###that did not happen.###i would appreciate it if on the close of this item of business i might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group.###this is an important matter.###it would be useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.###madam president i do not wish to reopen the debate but i had also asked for the floor to comment on mr barn crespos motion.###you did not call me either.###i regret this but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.###i am terribly sorry mr hnsch and mr cox.###i did not see you asking to speak.###even so i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes.###when we adopt the minutes for today s sitting tomorrow then any members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.###this seems to me to be a workable solution.###of course the minutes for tomorrow s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.###i think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely timeconsuming explanations of votes.###mr cox mr hnsch would this be acceptable to you.###madam president if the vote records correctly how my group voted i shall not and cannot object to that.###if your ruling is that i cannot give an explanation of vote i accept that but with reservations.###we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes as we always do of course.###if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted then we may correct them if necessary.###the order of business was adopted thus amended###safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods###the next item is the report a000000000 by mr koch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterways c000000000  00000000cod.###commissioner madam president ladies and gentlemen i can be quite frank in saying that i welcome the councils common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway.###firstly we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of directive 0000ec which obliges the member states to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.###secondly by adopting this directive we achieve a an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped b a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c equal opportunities for safety advisers on the european labour market.###thirdly this directive as it currently stands in the common position guarantees  in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards  a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the european union by adopting it we contribute to the member states bearing a high level of individual responsibility.###all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.###our amendments from the first reading have i believe been taken into account very satisfactorily.###they have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance or they have been rejected because the corresponding european arrangements have not been included for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.###the one unanimously adopted amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive is something which i would urge you to support.###by not setting a specific date for the member states to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.###i would urge you to endorse this.###madam president we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads but also on our railways and waterways not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because  as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles  a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.###as an austrian i still have a vivid memory as i believe we all do of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the tauern tunnel where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.###the renovation project which lasted for months cut off this important route between the north and south of europe.###the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit.###in fact all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.###prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards welltrained safety advisers being available so that the right action is taken in good time.###all the same we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety.###we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the member states in good time and  even more importantly  we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.###please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.###i should like to address one final point.###we must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that where transport safety in europe is concerned there is still much more to be done.###in this context i should like to make a request and ask the commissioner responsible who is with us here today to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future so that we in europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.###madam president first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which has at its heart the issue of transport safety.###the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road rail and inland waterway.###i congratulate him on his excellent report.###transport safety has sadly been in the news recently the paddington rail crash in london the terrible rail crash in norway the two aviation crashes involving eu citizens and the natural disaster involving the erika off brittany  all within the last four months  remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.###the rapporteur has pointed out to the house that in its common position the council has accepted six of parliaments ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of parliaments other amendments has been retained.###my group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the european union as safe as possible.###when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.###we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.###madam president i would like to make a few comments.###i would like first of all to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and secondly the commission for the proposal it has submitted.###we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also in fact with minimum requirements.###this is a pity in a sense.###needless to say safety on roads railways and inland waterways is of key importance and given the international nature of these types of transport training for safety advisors should also be harmonised therefore as well as the requirements of the new adr for example which is under way.###this is important but so is enforcement and there are of course a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.###just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years for example in belgium the netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.###or ships from eastern europe which moor adjacent to ships over here with all the obvious risks that this entails.###furthermore it has transpired that research in the ports in belgium finland but also in japan has shown that 00 of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.###in short the issue is an important one.###if we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 0 january of this year.###there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present especially with smaller companies as these cannot afford safety advisors.###these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo which causes problems.###it is therefore also being requested that iso 0000 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.###the work is done.###all that remains is the business of enforcement.###i would like to mention one final point.###with regard to enforcement proper agreements must also be concluded with the eastern european countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 0 july 0000 that is to say in eighteen months time.###this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.###this is not in itself anything dreadful but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road rail and inland waterways and incorporate these as part of the acquis communautaire as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.###madam president the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so.###the ever increasing volume of goods passing through europe entails all kinds of risks known and unknown for employees and the social environment.###those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.###the relevant standards which have been laid down in another directive 0000ec seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.###i am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the council on minimum standards regarding examinations although i would have preferred it if uniform set standards and modules had been established so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.###this however does not seem feasible.###finally the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can therefore give it my wholehearted support.###mr president commissioner i should first like to congratulate mr koch on his reports which though technical are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.###i should like to make just a few comments.###firstly i should like to ask the commissioner  and i am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground  to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety be it on the roads on the waterways or at sea.###considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a commission proposal first made on 00 march 0000 even though parliament responded relatively quickly this time lag is a little too long.###this is not just the fault of the commission but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.###my second point has already been mentioned it concerns the minimum standards.###in principle i believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and countryspecific rules.###however when it comes to safety i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden for example is in principle no different from safety in germany italy or austria.###i can live with these minimum standards but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully.###should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.###my third point has also been mentioned already.###as you know like mr rack i come from a transit country where this issue plays a particularly important role.###we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as austria or other transit countries.###but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum in all countries whether they are transit countries or not.###mr president i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur mr koch on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway.###we understand that it is important that the two institutions  parliament and commission  cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the committee on regional policy and in particular the transport group is magnificent.###the common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and at second reading we can accept the amendment on the proposed date which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the commission bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.###very briefly i would like to thank the various members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the commission s priorities in the field of transport.###as mr simpson has said very correctly this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.###the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.###in this regard i would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels which messrs rack and swoboda have referred to which in the case of austria is doubtless a very sensitive issue and great effort should be made to improve their safety.###in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.###margarine and a few kilos of paint which in principle do not present risks led to a genuine disaster.###therefore we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.###finally i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.###this week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport in light of the erika disaster and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.###but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission.###as i will say in the debate on the erika disaster we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.###i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur mr koch.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###transport of dangerous goods by road###the next item is the report a000000000 by mr koch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 0000ec on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road com0000 000  c000000000  00000000cod.###mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road which entered into force on 0 january 0000 contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the cen that is the european committee for standardisation.###delays in the cen s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.###in particular annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.###i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.###in this respect i accept this proposal to amend directive 0000ec which has been tabled for discussion today.###should the european union fail to take action then member states would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period until the cen completes its work which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.###the amendment to the directive on todays agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community.###it merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines deletes provisions which are no longer applicable and lays down the procedures for a carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b enacting less stringent national regulations in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.###the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity the member states obtain more powers.###the commission decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own.###in so doing it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.###the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down afresh in the council decision of june 0000.###the proposal to be discussed today to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road dates from may 0000 however and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.###two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.###we would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the council has to make a decision  which is not clearly worded  is set at a maximum of three months.###in addition the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.###a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements in particular for vacuum tanks if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below 00c.###this is in the special interest of northern european regions.###a final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 0 january 0000 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.###i do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety but i would ask you to endorse this report.###mr president colleagues a happy new year and millennium to you all.###i am speaking for the first time in this plenary partsession so this is quite exciting for me a little like first love although that did last longer than two minutes.###i would like to briefly comment on the commission s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.###it is good that this directive should be established now as otherwise member states would have to amend their national acts for a very short time a period of transition which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to eu bureaucracy.###the commission s proposal however does not take account of all the facts such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.###consequently i have tabled some amendments to mr koch s intrinsically excellent report which have been adopted by our committee.###my amendments concern the frostresistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.###according to the commission s proposal 00c would have been sufficient.###on the shores of the mediterranean it is hard to imagine that in lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.###there is support for the eu in lapland also so let us remember them.###i have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to 00c.###this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.###i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow s vote.###mr president with your permission i should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.###i thought that it was quite superb.###on the subject at hand i think that the people of europe must be able to be confident that the goods  however dangerous they are  which are transported on europes roads railways and so on are as safe as possible.###this directive is a contribution to this.###what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.###the rapporteur mr koch to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the cen which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.###that is why we can only hope  and we should resolve all of this this week  that in 0000 we will finally have community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.###commissioner mr president i would first like to thank mr koch for his excellent report which i do not have a great deal to add to.###i would like to take the opportunity just to point out that the transport of dangerous goods continues to cause major problems not just in india where i have just come from but also within the eu.###we only have to think of the serious accident in the mont blanc tunnel about a year ago not to mention the one in the tauern tunnel.###we observe that there is always a possibility of major problems of this kind occurring where nature gives rise to troublesome phenomena such as mist storms or cold weather particularly in the narrow alpine passes.###in general i would urge that the transport of dangerous goods is transferred more to rail.###in this context when planning future railway tracks or motorways a preventative approach should be taken and the appropriate longterm solution built into the process early on.###i would remind you of the brenner base tunnel which has not been touched on even indirectly.###while i am on the subject i would also like to point out that transport problems are one of the key issues facing the eu and call on the commission to give due attention to this.###we need to have much more probing and vigorous debate on cuttingdown on transport heavy rail traffic road pricing and railway privatisation with a view to improving functionality.###considering that enlargement towards the east will create a few more problems then it becomes clear to us all that the future credibility of the eu will depend on whether and in what manner we succeed in sorting out the transport situation.###mr president the report we are discussing here does not in itself entail any major changes.###most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.###it is nonetheless worth emphasising that each time we make this type of decision it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.###very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu both on roads and railways and by sea.###this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.###in area after area we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states.###this is extraordinarily positive and there is cause to thank the rapporteur mr koch for the work he has put in on this issue.###this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.###if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also as far as possible apply to every country.###i should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance namely an amendment tabled by member of parliament mr ari vatanen.###in many ways the prerequisites differ from one member state to another.###by approving this amendment we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union.###this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.###it is good that in establishing the present regulations we can also be flexible.###i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment.###mr president i would like to thank not only mr koch but also the vicepresident of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.###the reason mr koch produced his sound report was because the work in the cen and within the united nations economic commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.###i would like to ask the vicepresident if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations and whether the eu is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.###for one thing is clear even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the european union traffic does not stop at our borders it goes beyond them.###hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more farreaching regional provisions.###if the commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the cen and the economic commission are at.###mr president i would once again like to congratulate mr koch on his magnificent work on this other report which in a way supplements the debate which we held in october on rail transport.###we all regret that the european committee for standardisation cen has not been able in the required time to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the european union.###this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this europe of ours.###a moment ago mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures not of 00 degrees below zero but of 00 degrees below zero.###of course we accept that amendment  it is absolutely right  and i believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the european union which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.###i would like to say with regard to mr swoboda s comments on the activity of the cen that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if despite the new deadline we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.###lastly mr president the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out.###we have referred to the delay by the cen the amendment of certain provisions the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.###the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur mr koch which are contained in the various amendments specifically four.###we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###structural funds  cohesion fund coordination###the next item is the report a000000000 by mrs schroedter on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the communication from the commission in the field of the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund guidelines for programmes in the period 00000000 com0000000  c000000000  00000000cos.###mr president commissioner ah now i see commissioner fischler is here and there i was thinking that you would not be coming.###welcome to parliament.###ladies and gentlemen we cannot overlook the fact that the benefits of the european internal market are reaped most of all by the wealthy regions and even there they are not enjoyed by all sections of the population.###how long do we actually intend to allow this kind of development to go on for resulting as it does in the widening gulf between poor and wealthy regions.###whilst in the fifth report on the situation in the regions unemployment was seven times higher in the poor regions than in the wealthy regions the sixth report is already talking in terms of it being eight times higher despite the fact that european structural funds are pouring into the regions.###hence it will of course come as no surprise to anyone that the very preamble to the new structural funds regulation places great emphasis on the call for the funds to be implemented more efficiently and in a more concentrated manner in order to achieve the european objectives of high employment levels and sustainable development to name but a few.###parliament but above all the member states demanded massive improvements.###this was very soon forgotten however when the commission developed the new instrument for the purpose the guidelines and wanted to make the requirement for there to be efficiency concentration and simplification of administration in the implementation of the european structural funds more binding.###subsequently the member state governments referred to the principle of subsidiarity and just wanted to get their hands on the money.###and so all that remained of the 0000 berlin summit was the indicative nature of the guidelines.###however this at least places the commission under the obligation to approve only those programmes that will actually enable european objectives to be achieved.###i may have my doubts as to whether this indicative instrument will actually succeed in achieving efficiency and increased concentration and in actually putting the european objectives into practice but it is a fact that the guidelines will be of central importance to the negotiations for the community development programme.###if you want our work at european level to be taken seriously then you must also take it seriously yourselves.###parliament was not in a position to go into the content of the guidelines because it was not consulted until the legislative period was long since past.###now that the programming phases are so far on there is little point in starting from scratch again.###that is why in my report i concentrate on the strategic nature of the instrument with the blessing of the committee.###firstly the report assesses the impact of the instrument per se.###secondly it uncovers the shortcomings in the commission document.###for example the question of partnership was simply left out of the central part of the structural funds.###one searches the document in vain for the central principle which calls upon the member states to see that programmes are implemented at local level in conjunction not only with the local authorities and regions but also with local actors business and social organisations ngos unions employers associations women s organisations citizens initiatives and employment initiatives.###the question as to why it was left out has not been answered to date.###parliament makes demands here that are of central importance.###it expects the commission to only approve those programmes established on the basis of partnerships of this kind.###it surprised me members of the conservative group to suddenly find that amendments aimed at dropping the decentralising approach had been produced overnight.###all i can say is try taking this to your regions and explaining to your electorate why the european principle of decentralisation is not to be put into practice in the regions.###let me tell you you will not escape from that one unscathed.###we cannot have a situation where we agree principles in this house and when it comes to implementing them everyone does their own thing again.###incidentally i would just like to address a comment to the government of my country where there is a desire simply to ignore the horizontal community policy concerning environmental protection and where it was maintained that there was no need to implement the ffh guideline.###i believe it is a good thing that the commission is holding firm here.###this brings me to my final point.###the guidelines must serve as the hard and fast criteria we use to assess whether article 0 of the regulation is actually being implemented.###i expect the commission to ensure that the guidelines which certainly allow for adequate flexibility are in every sense the benchmark for the negotiations.###we represent the european position.###in other words sustainability in transport policy must be taken into account every bit as much as the entitlement of women to a share of financial support as must the fact that each programme should make provision for the overall contribution thus enabling there to be sustainable urban development and truly model projects in rural areas.###this is what i expect the outcome of the community development programmes to be and i do not expect you to give way on this again.###how else otherwise do we propose to reduce the unemployment rate.###not by continuing to wait and trying to cheat our way through again.###we cannot wait.###in a few years time we will no longer be able to spend so much money on implementing european structural policy because a great many more countries will be joining us and then we will have no choice but to create much improved more efficient and more concentrated structures.###and that will only be the beginning.###i therefore expect the commission to take parliament s demands seriously in the course of the negotiations and to actually put the european position into practice here giving a progressive regional policy a chance at long last.###mr president it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the european parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the united kingdom that i represent in this parliament namely wales.###a major part of wales as you know has been granted objective 0 status under the structural funds programme.###it is quite clear that many people within wales are looking to the european structural funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.###we have seen poverty growing in wales and growing still further since 0000.###we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.###we are looking therefore within the structural funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the principality.###what is however deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of structural funds assistance is something that has been in a sense a success of the government.###it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces.###that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront.###we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.###we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures.###we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.###we look to it to challenge the uk government to ensure that the private sector which surely must be providing the major impetus for structural funds expenditure is involved in the planning stage.###finally we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.###too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent.###this is one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wales.###mr president our committee views these issues very differently and to start i will speak from the point of view of research.###we see it as a very positive sign that in her own conclusions the rapporteur has taken account of our committee s proposal that the cohesion fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.###this will be possible with action on the part of governments and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.###another matter we would like to address specifically from the point of view of industrial policy is that we would have liked the commission to pay more attention to the effects of services electronic commerce and the growing use of the internet when they were planning the coordination of structural funds and cohesion funds.###poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.###the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry but today those areas might have become a burden and they may well be poor meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production as i might call it and the production of services because they are the industries of the future.###in my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this so on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research and energy i would draw the commission s attention to this issue.###finally as the committee representing energy we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from cohesion and regional development funds to have been emphasised still more thus through a process of coordination increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.###mr president i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that i am speaking for my colleague mrs flautre who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill.###i would like to draw peoples attention to amendments nos 0 and 0 which were agreed by the committee on employment and social affairs but not accepted by the committee on regional policy transport and tourism.###these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.###in the past this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.###these amendments also fit in with this parliaments view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.###we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.###in her report mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking yet desperately needed.###the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund.###but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 00000000 programme.###it could be said that the omission gives the impression that the commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between european social fund assistance which is subject to review after three and a half years and the member states annual national plans for employment.###we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.###mr president commissioner the proposal presented by the commission in accordance with its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development.###i would like to point out however that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us maintaining a population in rural areas given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.###this as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.###the consequences do not inspire hope.###it is the young people who are disappearing who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.###this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.###we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union.###agriculture only provides 0.0 of employment in the union.###furthermore three quarters of our farm workers are parttime and require supplements to their incomes.###for this reason one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the european union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside of the agricultural sector in sectors such as rural tourism sport culture heritage conservation the conversion of businesses new technologies services etc.###however even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive it is still essential not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.###therefore we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set.###we want rural areas at the dawn of the 00st century to be competitive and multifunctional both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of nonagricultural activities.###it is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium and to bear in mind the conclusions of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the five fundamental issues which have been only partly taken up by the committee on transport regional policy and tourism in its points 00 and 00.###in conclusion i would ask the commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because i believe that for the european union maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.###mr president commissioner i would like to begin by thanking mrs schroedter the rapporteur for her work.###i think that this work has been carried out extremely well.###i would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments  and perhaps there are more of them than we expected  but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.###we feel that it is important that the commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this parliament at least in spirit because at this stage it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise and nothing but hot air.###the truth of the matter though is that we believe  and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted  that the commission must take account of what is adopted by this parliament particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.###in our amendments we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the structural funds the cohesion fund and community initiatives so that their application should be reflected in the best and most profitable way by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are when all is said and done the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.###in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives we think that those who generate employment the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment that is businesspeople must participate in this initiative.###small and mediumsized businesses above all need to take part in the distribution of these funds.###if they do not if businesspeople feel marginalised if entrepreneurs cannot take part not only in managing but also in receiving these funds we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.###also in order to attain our objectives to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.###all of this must be done  i repeat  with the participation of private business which by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations but complementing them never obstructing or excluding them will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.###mr president it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague mr evans of why wales actually achieved objective 0 status.###it was because of the discredited policies of his own conservative party.###let me also remind him that when his party leader mr hague was secretary of state for wales he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from commissioner wulfmathies regarding regulatory requirements.###i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective 0 additionality.###i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation.###my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.###i want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.###the objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional lifesupport machine.###it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hitech sector.###it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that europe is rapidly losing ground to the us in the hitech growth industries of the future.###the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.###they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.###they should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development resulting in inevitable delays and underspends particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.###the implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer either in the commission or in the civil service.###there must be an internal coherence in the commission directorate while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes.###the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fundusers and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.###if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence which will be the key to future success.###this is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines whether eu regional policy with a good solid enabling guideline can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the eu.###mr president commissioner i would like to thank mrs schroedter for an excellent report.###she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.###the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.###we are badly behind now in this matter.###hopefully the stands parliament has taken will help however in the midterm appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.###for the time the report grew too large when it was being debated.###it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.###at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer union regional policy bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.###our group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity the responsibility of member states and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.###it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.###our group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.###we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the union and its member states exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.###projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.###funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.###projects have to be carried out more efficiently more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.###while the report was being prepared it was interesting to discuss the union s regional policy in general.###for us new members it was the first time and this was a very interesting process.###this report is very good and our group supports it.###mr president commissioner as proof that this parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution the excellent report by a fellow member of my group elisabeth schroedter has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 00000000 for objective 0 regions have been sitting in the commission s offices for several months.###bearing this in mind this house should in any event demand that before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved they be studied and submitted for debate in this parliament specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.###this is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and leastdeveloped regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards a fairer europe.###mr president we should not forget that the main strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.###we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.###we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a europe of citizens and not just in a europe of states and of regions.###we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.###we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.###some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.###we will have to study several indicators which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others and how they are evolving.###it is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to parliament s plenary sitting today that europe s 00 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 00 least prosperous regions.###this fact means that the european parliament the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically.###i agree that the european parliament did not have the opportunity  or that it was not given the opportunity as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term  to discuss the directives.###i do not think however that this report has come too late.###we need to consider it together so that the new objective 0 programmes and the plans for regional development which have been drafted before the directives come into force can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.###we all agree that we should ask that halfway through these programmes when the assessment of the directives is made parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens representatives.###our citizens cannot accept that the european union takes decisions in a way that is at least on the face of it bureaucratic.###they need to see the political dimension working to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.###this is what we are today asking the commissioner for.###i would like to think that given his previous experience as a regional president he will agree to propose indicators and a strategy which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.###mr president i support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the period 00000000 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of eu structural and cohesion funds.###this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.###member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.###this latter point is of particular importance.###while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.###we do not want to build a europe of cities alone.###the structural funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries mainly through the upgrading of roads water treatment and related transport networks.###this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary partsession.###key eu programmes between 0000 0000 0000 and 0000 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 0 regions within europe.###the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date.###this would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions the poorer regions in europe are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone as well as within an everexpanding internal market where the free movement of goods persons services and capital exist.###in conclusion while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the european regional development fund and the cohesion fund we should remember that the european social fund has played a very important role in helping the less welloff in our society.###the social fund has certainly improved our thirdlevel institutions financed our postleaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and longterm unemployment assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.###mr president on numerous occasions in the past i have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues.###this time however i actually agree with her.###whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path i cannot say.###nevertheless i would like to commend her on her work.###the second point i would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex as we and mrs mccarthy as rapporteurs for the general regulation had asked.###unfortunately this did not happen.###mr berni is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.###i am raising the issue just to reiterate parliament s position.###thirdly we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.###they are particularly beneficial to the member states and i would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development job creation and more particularly on equal opportunities and transport issues.###personally i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.###as an islander however i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.###this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves.###this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament and i have raised the issue time and time again.###commissioner we shall continue to raise the issue as article 000 paragraph 0 of the treaty of amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.###therefore the commission should address the issue once and for all.###the time has come to implement the programmes and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.###as for us in parliament i would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which was signed in may.###i am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.###mr president commissioner in this minute and a half i should like first of all to congratulate mrs schroedter.###i know many have already done so but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides and i think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.###i share the regrets she expressed namely that parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that i cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect which in my view is a pity.###consequently i feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the midterm review in 0000 and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 0000.###in brief i would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 00000000 which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.###the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.###subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.###we must ask ourselves a fundamental question how can we ensure that union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development.###the second challenge is that of enlargement which will of course have a considerable impact both in budgetary and geographical terms.###these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us.###finally in this time of natural disasters i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds.###as you know it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation.###europe should not be completely absent as the states tend to want.###public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.###i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.###i also think we should ensure or ask member states to ensure that there is some publicity given to european aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.###mr president the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.###as far as french planning experts are concerned for example the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.###well the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.###our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.###its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds.###what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at european level.###the commission however though bound to issue guidelines does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.###the report put forward today reestablishes its place in the political sphere.###it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.###this is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.###mr president i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.###over the coming years faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement europe will more than ever before require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.###to this end europe as a whole and each member state individually will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities including the structural funds.###for this to be possible what we need from the european commission are not just good intentions but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the member states.###for example in recent years italy has had problems in utilising the structural funds mainly because of excessive bureaucracy insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.###there are therefore two points to which i would like to draw the commission s attention.###firstly we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decisionmaking precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.###secondly a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent since they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated to the point of hindering access to the funds.###this is something about which european small and mediumsized businesses in particular tend to complain.###i will conclude mr president by saying that the failure of the commission s communication to focus on territorial pacts and especially methods of combating unemployment among women and young people is cause for serious concern.###mr president like my colleague mr evans it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue especially since i represent a part of the united kingdom the west midlands which has hitherto benefited from objective 0 funding in particular.###but the report before the house tonight is a prime example of how if we are not very careful we can produce very grandiosesounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.###the report itself is wellintentioned but as so often when we deal with these issues lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.###that is why i and my group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text not to take anything away from the proposal but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.###i would like to explain our thinking here.###firstly we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds.###past experience dictates that as the elected representatives of the european taxpayer we should and indeed must demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as value for money indicators in the grantgiving process.###next we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.###but at the midway point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.###our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer but we also avoid the wellrehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.###finally we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.###there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.###also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from smallscale revenuebased projects which are hard to monitor towards capital schemes where in the majority of cases the benefits are there for all to see.###that way the muchtrumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the european parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.###if these changes to the report are supported by the house today i believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about namely to assist  in a financially sustainable manner  those deprived areas of the european union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living not by giving a handout but by giving a handup.###i urge the house to support these changes.###mr president commissioner i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.###the european union s structural and cohesion policies are without doubt essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.###despite the steps taken thus far these levels are still very high and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.###these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thoughtout and sensible guidelines.###let us not forget that when these policies are effective they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life.###let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the european union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development unless of course the commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the european mainland.###in closing i would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium for which we all hope for the best.###mr president mrs schroedter s report undoubtedly contains several important observations and i would like to congratulate her on that.###however i feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community s regional policy.###quite briefly structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way rather it aggravates it.###the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers particularly in the south.###regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states.###if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.###little consideration if any at all has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure transport communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.###the union s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.###a large section of the union s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grassroots.###unfortunately the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.###mr president i would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the union.###the first is the fundamental central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.###we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously.###we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union s fundamental objectives.###secondly i agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and i would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.###in future we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as in my country the islands of the azores and madeira.###i would like to ask if the commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the commission s report on the outermost regions which has been long awaited by parliament.###mr president first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.###mr president commissioner the guidelines are intended to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.###however contrary to their claim to provide guidance the commission s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.###nonetheless their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.###i agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the member states on simplifying administration and i support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labourintensive small and mediumsized enterprises on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing and on startup help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.###i am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my group to paragraph 00 to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.###i should be very grateful mrs schroedter if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.###mr president commissioner in the committee on employment and social affairs we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the structural and cohesion funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.###unfortunately the excellent schroedter report did not take account of this criterion despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show  as we shall see later in the berend report  how in fact these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from europe s most highlydeveloped regions.###they are growing but only in terms of gdp.###they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.###commissioner please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs and treat it as a matter of priority because this is our citizens greatest problem.###please take account in strategic terms in the revision and in the allocation of reserves of employment needs because this fundamentally is what the structural funds and the cohesion funds require.###mr president it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial sevenyear period 00000000 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation particularly for women and young people and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.###it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas employment in rural areas aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the european union and for the greek islands which of course comprise half of the islands of the union as stipulated in article 000 of the treaty.###cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.###mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to mrs schroedter s report.###everyone understands mrs schroedter ladies and gentlemen the reasons and the time limits involved  and i shall come back to this point presently  and whatever the time limits or delays since we are discussing this report right now as the representative for the commission i consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 00000000 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.###mrs schroedter you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the member states and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters european union cofinancing of the programmes requires and is the justification for a situation where community priorities as debated and approved in this house should also be taken into account in order to promote this community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.###so ladies and gentlemen i should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you mrs schroedter and the various members of this house have made.###regarding the role and structure of these guidelines mr hatzidakis mrs schroedter and mrs mccarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of structural fund objectives 0 0 and 0 as well as their links with the cohesion funds.###this means putting forward the commission s priorities based on past experience in implementing the programmes as well as current community policies relating to structural operations.###the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use to the optimum and efficient use as some of you have wished of community involvement including mr bradbourn using if necessary the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monies.###when i speak of optimum utilisation i am referring both to the national and regional levels.###and so mr seppnen i shall also mention at this point speaking of the national level the link with the cohesion fund.###this is the purpose of these guidelines.###regarding their content as you know ladies and gentlemen of this house they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but at the same time very passionately as i understood her presentation just now.###the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create in all sectors but especially in the private sector as mr berend said the maximum number of serious worthwhile and permanent jobs the competitiveness of regional economies all regional economies and in particular mr evans that of wales but not only of wales.###and because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission let me also add the regional economies of the european regions handicapped by their distance from the centre be they remote regions island regions or of course the most remote regions which are naturally the most distant.###perhaps i may inform mr ribeiro e castro who asked me about this that as i wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions the commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.###concerning the most remote regions it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments but this is not necessarily an excuse just an explanation.###we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.###i myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 00 november and within the college we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions.###i would thank you for your understanding in this matter.###so that is the first priority the competitiveness of regional economies.###the second priority which several of you have stressed mr puerta in particular but there were others not that i am mentioning them in any order of priority is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.###ladies and gentlemen we now have a european union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great proving the effectiveness and worth of the cohesion fund but where at the same time in relation to unemployment  as you wrote mrs schroedter  an increasing gap exists between the 00 or 00 richest regions and the 00 or 00 poorest or most disadvantaged regions.###this is a situation which is as it should be unjustifiable and intolerable.###as far as i am concerned  taking into account my own concept of the construction of europe and regional development policy in particular  this is a situation which i find unacceptable and i have every intention as far as possible with your support of dedicating all the appropriations for which i am responsible to this improved social human and territorial cohesion particularly in order to prevent what i once called in this house a twospeed europe a europe of wealthy districts but at the same time a europe of impoverished areas.###the third objective is urban and rural development within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.###in fact the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account.###the first is rural development and let me say mrs schroedter that i am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport an issue i have been involved in personally for a long time.###i particularly remember the time when i was minister for the environment in my own country.###the second principle is that of equal opportunities particularly for men and women as well as the european strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary union.###finally and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this house particularly yourself mrs schroedter in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies for development or redevelopment which of all the priorities offer the maximum opportunity to synergy to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership.###you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership yet there is a clear reference to it on page 0 of the guidelines.###however i do wish to mention  since you have asked me to do so  that as far as i am concerned this partnership  and i spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely  is a tool one used to involve local brainpower be it in the public sector in the form of elected representatives the social and educational sectors associations or in the private sector a decentralised partnership and let me mention in this connection in response to mrs angelilli the territorial pacts which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.###these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities since they must be taken into consideration under each of the objectives to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the member states and regions.###i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made ladies and gentlemen and firstly on procedure.###it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date.###let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the commission in the form of a draft in february 0000 in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text my predecessor mrs wulfmathies presented them to parliament immediately.###due to the elections to the european parliament taking place around this time however parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted in july 0000.###here in this chamber ladies and gentlemen among you i wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning  mr hatzidakis asked me a question about this  as far as member states are concerned your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.###and let me assure you furthermore that when the commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the midterm review in mind in line with the regulations then the point of view of this house as expressed in this report will also be taken into account.###now to the form.###on the subject of the role of the guidelines mrs schroedter you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives often very precise ones should be provided.###i shall not list them all but they include implementing intersectoral policies increasing efficiency in the use of public funds assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together etc.###the commission takes note of these but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents such as the guide to the reform of the structural funds or the methodological working document.###drawing to a close i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated mrs schroedter.###i am thinking for example of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.###this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring s negotiations.###the commission kept to the actual text of article 00 of the structural funds regulations which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide member states with broad indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed community policies.###i actually quoted the text itself in quotation marks.###moreover the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.###you then mentioned mrs schroedter the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.###i find the opposite the case.###i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches and shall attach to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.###indeed i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere.###as regards rural development which a number of you brought up particularly mrs redondo jimnez the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas but also protection of the environment and europe s rural heritage.###it must however be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the structural funds whose objectives 0 and 0 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.###and indeed on the subject of the balance of rural society let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the eaggf guarantee section aimed at promoting reform in european agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.###at this stage i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective 0 rural areas in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective 0 regions.###in any event i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter.###before concluding i should like to tell mr savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck france austria and germany in particular in the last few weeks and at the same time we shall once again be discussing together with my fellow commissioner mrs de palacio what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of france.###i shall therefore reserve the right if you permit sir to give you my own opinion which to a great extent matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using objective 0.###i shall remind you that the commission is going to be approving the objective 0 zoning plans for france sweden austria and luxembourg tomorrow.###we shall then have an appropriate tool for working particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.###indeed this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.###in conclusion with thanks for your understanding mr president i should like to thank you mrs schroedter for the quality of your work and that of the committee and to tell you that i am very pleased apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines.###we have discussed this and i have attempted to clarify my point of view.###i am very pleased with the level of support offered by your house to the commission in establishing these guidelines which have been submitted to the member states for information when establishing their own programmes.###this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 00000000 programmes.###i feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions at this time when programming for the period 00000000 is being undertaken good joint working practice which is mr hatzidakis backed up by something i am very attentive to observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union###the next item is the debate on the report a000000000 by mr berend on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union sec000000  c0000000  00000000cos.###mr president commissioner barnier ladies and gentlemen the sixth periodic report contains a comprehensive and detailed description of the economic and social situation in the union s regions and of their development trends and represents as i see it a solid basis for the formulation of structural policy priorities at union level.###the report demonstrates that  measured in terms of gross domestic product per capita  the poorest regions are beginning to catch up and that is how the situation is set to continue.###this can largely be attributed to the structural funds even though the disparity between the poorest and wealthiest regions is still considerable.###employing european structural funds has already enabled convergence in standards of living.###over a ten year period the gap in average gdp has been reduced by ten percent.###this has particularly affected the four cohesion countries  in the positive sense of course  as it has the five former east german lnder.###unfortunately this europeanwide development was due in the main to an increase in productivity and only partly to an increase in the level of employment.###hence we would urge the commission and the member states to give due attention to the effect measures have on employment in future.###the lion s share of the transfer payments has been and still is used for investment in rationalisation and modernisation with the intention of improving labour productivity.###however this has dampened the effect of structural policy on employment.###this is not an assessment but for the moment merely an observation.###the report establishes however that regional differences in the labour market have in fact continued to increase.###unemployment is currently at 00 in 00 of the weakest regions.###ten years ago it was 0 lower i.e. 00.###and i might just mention that in the 00 best regions unemployment averages 0.0 it was 0.0 ten years ago hence there has been an increase of only 0.0.###the report makes clear the fact that 00 of unemployment is structural unemployment.###that is why  and this is the conclusion we can draw from this report  promoting competitiveness within industry and infrastructure for economic activity must be central to the structural policy in that order.###the corollary to this it has to be said is that measures for the retraining and ongoing training of the work force are of no small importance either.###in addition more attention must be given to boosting entrepreneurial potential in small and mediumsized enterprises and the services they call upon must be developed further.###another conclusion to be drawn from the report is that if financial support is to be utilised efficiently then the measures must be brought into line with the broadly diversified means of support intended to establish a middleclass and minimum standard of living.###a very important point to my mind.###in the conclusions of this report we make the commission aware that the legal bases for cooperation between regions and member states and applicant countries must be improved and point to how crucial it is for the budget to be consolidated as a prerequisite to the success of economic and monetary union and enlargement eastwards.###we call upon those member states that have not yet submitted a satisfactory map of development regions to do so immediately and of course we expect the commission to examine with due haste the operational programmes for the regions for the new support period 0000 to 0000 in the light of the results of the sixth periodic report and to do everything possible to enable this support period to commence without delay in those areas where it is needed and in the proper manner.###mr president commissioner this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.###i consider however that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in europe offers a somewhat oversimplified view of the situation and unfortunately this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.###the commission report generally relativises this observation particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the union in which i have a special interest by which i mean the french overseas departments and more generally the most remote regions.###in this respect i am pleased to see that the committee on regional policy transport and tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and more specifically to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new article 0000 of the treaty of amsterdam.###finally in my view this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of europe particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of europe and its more remote regions.###even if the commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the community area through the union s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the sec.###mr president the group of the party of european socialists in this parliament agrees with the report that mr berend has just presented and congratulates the author both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.###it must be remembered that currently the european union s overall competitiveness is in general terms 00 of that of the united states of america and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units that is the regions also improves.###furthermore this is at a time when technological development economic globalisation and our problems which are enlargement and the single currency demand that the regions as well as businesses and individuals make more of an effort to be competitive.###the european commission s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.###i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur one positive and one negative.###the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the union and that the community funds have been a major although not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities.###the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the european regions gdp and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.###it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.###this commissioner is the first commandment for the coming period.###thus mr president i ask my fellow members to approve this report and i ask the commission as other speakers have done to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 00000000.###mr president commissioner i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.###the sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the union s regional policy aims.###the report shows that growth has been uneven despite all our efforts.###very rapid growth is continuing in central europe.###the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general european average whereas many southern european and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.###we now require an indepth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.###is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences long distances climates that are too cold or too hot sparse populations and austere conditions.###how can the union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development.###it is also important to discover what the effects of union enlargement will be on structural funds and the development of the union s more remote areas.###the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility.###some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased.###this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.###in the future we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.###for example uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.###in this connection too weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development.###it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and knowhow.###our group is in favour of adopting this report.###mr president commissioner the european union s regional policy has until now not been able to interpret in any significant way the existing differences in our inhabitants incomes.###we have a serious situation in which in the european union today there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached on average 00.0 in the regions worst affected regions which also happen to be poor areas whilst in the 00 regions with the lowest unemployment corresponding to the richer areas unemployment stands at just 0.###given this situation the report approved by parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes which are often misspent with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the transeuropean rail networks which are due in 0000.###there should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries agriculture and fisheries which are often harmed by the european union s own insensitive policies as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs particularly for women and young people.###only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.###mr president commissioner mr berend s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the european commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.###the overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation boosting equality of opportunity increasing the sustainability of employment and development are only mentioned in passing.###this attitude appears to me to be unjustified.###i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.###this does not mean that i do not see the need for competitiveness particularly as i myself am an entrepreneur in an objective 0 region that is in brandenburg in the federal republic of germany and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and mediumsized enterprises.###it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the objective 0 regions that is to say job creation measures special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.###they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities.###supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development simply because there is no basis for a selfsupporting upturn in these objective 0 regions.###after all the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 0 in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.###concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demandorientated economic policy is not the answer.###and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and to a lesser extent in rationalisation.###it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demandorientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.###the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.###in other words what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.###for example these would be measures for vocational training for further education for reintegrating people who have already been excluded from the production process for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.###mr president my compliments to the rapporteur for his indepth report.###the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union.###by stimulating a diversity of investments the european union is endeavouring to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment.###from the sixth periodic report on the regions one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.###the efforts made in order to drive up the gdp per capita in objective 0 regions do not always result in such an increase not really a satisfying result over a period during which certainly over the past couple of years there has been economic growth.###as indicated by the rapporteur the effects of the structural measures on the other hand are minimal as far as employment is concerned.###some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for.###also the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.###mr president it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities especially in connection with boosting employment.###it is after all they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.###by allowing them to develop tailormade plans for the relevant regions and if necessary tying this in with financial aid a higher return can be achieved.###surely this must be the ultimate goal.###i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions.###following on from this it is probably also more meaningful with regard to the financial aid to regions to give member states more say anyway.###by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.###finally i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries.###the report shows that in general they are a long way behind eu countries especially in terms of gdp per capita.###with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy.###i would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.###mr president commissioner following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.###for example whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased there has been a certain amount of convergence between the member states themselves in this respect.###equally unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all indeed they rose in some cases.###i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.###even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.###since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout europe to reduce unemployment then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.###genuine structural reforms and a competitionfriendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.###if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a costintensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.###we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.###mr president commissioner my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.###this issue which has an impact on their everyday life is a key issue as regards eu credibility.###it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided i would say quite magnificently the development of poor countries.###i remember what portugal and greece used to be like when i drove through those countries for the first time twentyfive years ago.###in this connection french speakers would speak of a coup de chapeau  in other words i take my hat off to the eu.###the eu really deserves such a gesture but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.###what is the result.###people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.###consequently we have to build schools hospitals and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.###this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.###most people however would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised if they were given the chance to in other words if there was work there.###we must give them this opportunity.###this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have.###the solution as i see it lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.###by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business but creating will.###i mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life whether he or she is an employee the owner of a business or an official.###what is a fair society.###one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.###in this way positive development of the regions is also possible because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.###finally i would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from america where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy as it often is here in europe.###mr president commissioner as my time is limited i shall get straight to the point.###firstly let me make a statement of fact the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the union.###the most remote regions still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates offer one example of this.###in reunion for example the rate is 00.###this is not a situation related to the economic climate however rather it is a structural problem created by our remoteness our insularity in short our own specific personality.###the principle of specific exceptional treatment was envisaged in article 0000 of the treaty of amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.###it only remains to put this principle into practice.###the commission document expected to be ready in december 0000 was delayed until january then february and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.###i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission.###as regards taxation state aid the structural funds and defending our traditional products practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.###if these do not materialise then unfortunately convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions despite the size of the amounts committed will end in failure.###mr president as all the previous speakers have done i should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.###just like the previous report this extremely competent and precise analysis the recommendations it supports and your own comments ladies and gentlemen shall prove useful to the commission in general and to the commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 00000000.###i should also like to make a few comments firstly mr berend regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.###you pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote if i am not mistaken that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.###on behalf of all the officials of the commission and my predecessor mrs wulfmathies i must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this house and by yourself.###the commission was certainly very anxious to ensure mr berend that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.###i am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 0.0 of this report where the commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported improved and influenced by factors which some of you  mr markov just now and mrs raschhofer  stressed very forcefully.###i am thinking of technological research and development infrastructure provision and quality human resources potential small and mediumsized businesses and direct investment from abroad.###so much for the quality.###i do not wish to spend time right now mr berend going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed.###let me just itemise them the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the member states.###secondly partnership a subject which a number of you stressed the role of local and regional authorities the private sector both sides of industry associations and local community action groups.###regarding this problem of partnership i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly.###thirdly the need to develop the employment side of growth even though i am aware as mr van dam just said that the prime responsibility is that of the member states and that when we speak of the responsibility of member states and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.###mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.###mr fruteau we at least need to recognise that there is growth and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession as has been the case in the past.###you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.###i agree with your analysis.###when there is growth it must be better distributed but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness be they the most remote or island regions is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.###fourthly a point which mrs hedkvist petersen stressed just now the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.###fifthly the importance and role of small and mediumsized businesses.###mr vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.###finally the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the structural funds the motives of officials in managing these funds even if it is occasionally complicated and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation followup and supervision of the commission.###in relation to this i must inform the european parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 0000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of structural funds.###i should like to mention a few specific points.###mr berend you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.###well we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.###tomorrow the commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon i hope it will be italy s turn.###you may therefore be satisfied on this point since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 0.###regarding the informal economy you mention in your report i am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and as mr cocilovo mentioned there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.###to a certain extent they are taken into account in the statistics on gdp and labour force surveys and in any case i wish to point out the efforts which eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.###mr berend you also mentioned as did mr aparicio snchez the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.###on this point which is of personal interest to me let me remind you that the small scale of this sector  and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area  and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.###this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries under commissioner fischler.###nonetheless i must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which no doubt will respond better to these concerns.###several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.###i wish to assure you firstly that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is as far as i am concerned mr berend an extremely important instrument not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of europe and furthermore with the elected representatives i.e. yourselves on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a european regional planning policy.###in any event i have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report the definition compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of central and eastern europe a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned particularly mrs sudre and mr fruteau analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of central and eastern europe.###this will constitute a great challenge to us all for you and for the commission in the next few years.###and finally there are the crossborder aspects.###i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.###finally i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are in any case familiar with but whose main elements i should like to reiterate.###ladies and gentlemen considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence particularly for the four cohesion countries but also frankly mr pohjamo for the objective 0 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development especially regarding infrastructure.###this is my first point regarding the policy.###my second point regarding the policy is as follows the structural funds have made and continue to make a significant contribution to the convergence process.###all the macroeconomic models we are working on show that over the last decade more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the structural funds.###i have however taken note particularly with regard to the most remote regions mrs sudre mr fruteau and mr nogueira romn too that your observation is that there is still much to do  and this is my third point regarding the policy  in terms of improving employment takeup aspects the fight against social exclusion which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.###now to my fourth point regarding the policy enlargement of the union the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions the major challenge too for the european policy on cohesion a point which mr van dam highlighted.###i shall say that something is already taking shape in berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.###i am thinking in particular of the preaccession structural instrument which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.###you see ladies and gentlemen we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the union s enlargement on our structural policy.###this sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole mr berend is a good basis for our thinking for us all and for myself.###i should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 00000000.###thank you very much commissioner.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###the sitting was closed at 0.00 p.m.###adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting###the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed.###are there any comments.###mr president i respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the minutes.###i refer to item 00 on the order of business.###firstly i believe the issue raised by the president of the socialist group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the president of the commission on the fiveyear strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.###i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group.###the second point i would like to make  and which i would have wished to make yesterday before the vote  is that this parliament as other speakers remarked yesterday can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the european commission.###we should also have the humility to recognise that if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the president of the commission but also by a fiveyear programme we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this house so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the commission what our wishes were.###there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this.###when there are major setpiece debates scheduled between this house and the european commission in the future we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.###there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission.###we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.###looking at some of the press reports of last friday i believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable selfrestraint in the way they commented publicly.###that is something for which i have a deep appreciation.###i hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which i believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.###it should not be dramatised into something more than that.###thank you very much mr cox.###i understand what you are saying.###we have taken note of this.###mr president concerning item 00 of the minutes on the order of business we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on todays agenda.###however it was withdrawn from the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.###it therefore needs to be withdrawn from todays agenda.###mr wynn that makes sense.###the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.###mr president regarding mrs lynnes comments yesterday about health and safety in this building i presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the tower.###this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.###i do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly but this is a serious problem.###mrs ahern we have taken note of this.###i would ask you to bring this specific case which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor to the attention of the quaestors who are in fact responsible for the matter.###we will also pass this on to our services however.###thank you very much.###the minutes were approved###reform of european competition policy###the next item is the joint debate on the following reports###a000000000 by mr von wogau on behalf of the committee on

commission s white paper on modernisation of the european competition rules has ignited intense and lively debate amongst interested members of the public.###the reactions from experts and persons affected range from complete rejection to unconditional support.###what is this white paper in fact about.###the existing system of european competition rules was set up in the early years of the community.###this system which is based on a centralised application and approvals procedure was certainly appropriate for the conditions prevailing at the time.###this procedure made a substantial contribution to the development of a european competition culture.###however the framework conditions have fundamentally changed in the 00 years since it came into being.###the community of 0 has enlarged to one of 00 and is set to undergo further enlargement to encompass 00 members.###but the system has hardly changed at all.###that is why there is an urgent need for reform and no one takes issue with this in debate.###nevertheless certain critics are of the opinion that the commission s proposals go too far.###the commission wants to abolish the application and approvals procedure and enhance the role of national authorities and courts in the implementation of the competition rules.###in other words this would mean a transition from an authorisation system to one of legal exemption.###however the prohibition principle and this is important is to be retained.###in principle i take the view that we ought when an authority accused of tending towards bureaucracy and centralism submits a proposal for debureaucratisation and decentralisation to at least give this serious consideration.###according to the commissions proposal it all revolves around competitioninhibiting agreements between enterprises and abuses of powerful positions.###however the notification obligation with respect to state aid and corporate concentrations is to be retained.###the committee on economic and monetary affairs gave its blessing in principle to these proposals put forward by the commission with only one vote against and two abstentions.###however it will only be possible to form a conclusive assessment once the currently awaited bills produced by the commission are published.###whilst i may endorse the commission s proposals in principle still there are a number of points that warrant improvement or at least clarification.###i would like to go into some of these points briefly.###many critics of the white paper maintain that decentralisation will jeopardise the consistent application of community legislation.###not all national authorities in particular the courts are in a position as yet to fulfil the role the commission has in mind for them when it comes to the application of the competition rules.###firstly in the course of the last few decades the national monopolies have familiarised themselves with the implementation of the competition rules to an adequate degree.###secondly the national courts will be empowered to implement articles 00 0 00 and 00 in accordance with the current administration of justice.###nonetheless it is still extremely important for the commission to support the national authorities and courts with group exemption regulations guidelines and notices.###furthermore cooperation between the national authorities and the commission as well as amongst the national authorities themselves must be strengthened.###as far as the competence of the national courts is concerned we recommend in this report that specialised courts be set up for dealing with monopolies law proceedings.###these are already in existence in certain member states and they have proved successful.###entrepreneurs for their part fear a loss of legal certainty.###in order to guard against this the enterprises should in certain cases continue to have the opportunity of being given prior clarification by the commission.###these are only a few albeit central aspects that must be taken into account where the modernisation of the european competition rules is concerned.###that said the process is still very much in its infancy.###discussion will continue until such time as legislative proposals are eventually produced.###however i am convinced of the fact that the white paper has put us on the right path.###a european competition culture has come into being in the course of the last few decades.###the decentralisation proposed by the commission accords with the principle of subsidiarity which has in fact now been firmly established in the treaty.###this leads to increased implementation of the european competition rules at national and regional level thereby making it possible for the european competition culture to be placed on a broader basis.###finally i would like to say that the competition policy reform we are introducing here is a necessity and that it is going to be absolutely necessary in this context to clarify that the european union s competition policy is an essential prerequisite to the success of a social market economy.###both the commission and parliament must do more than they have done hitherto to get the message across that competition policy competition between enterprises and the fact that the european commission is supervising this are first and foremost matters which have the interests of the citizens at heart.###mr president commissioner today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union s competition policy.###we are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for european monopolies law that is mr von wogau s report and it is far more controversial than the vote in the committee on economic and monetary affairs may have given us reason to believe.###i want to make it quite clear that in this specific case i personally consider the commission s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term modernisation to describe the content of articles 00 and 00 of the white paper or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression retrograde step .###however we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 0000 and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.###but of course both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper.###it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy.###on reading both commission documents one learns that 0000 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 0000 were pursued and even partially completed which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.###allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture.###as the competent authority the commission with its logically consistent approach has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition not always to the delight of the member states or enterprises concerned.###it should continue along this path.###but commissioner none of this is to become less complicated in future  one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the union the deepening of the internal market technological progress globalisation.###indeed it is not just about modernisation of community law more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions for the european competition policy will be dependent on the population s acceptance together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.###only without transparency there will be no acceptance indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.###the competition report 0000 is not a bad foundation for this but in fact there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.###resumption of the session###i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 00 december 0000 and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.###although as you will have seen the dreaded millennium bug failed to materialise still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.###you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this partsession.###in the meantime i should like to observe a minute s silence as a number of members have requested on behalf of all the victims concerned particularly those of the terrible storms in the various countries of the european union.###please rise then for this minute s silence.###the house rose and observed a minute s silence###madam president on a point of order.###you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka.###one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago.###would it be appropriate for you madam president to write a letter to the sri lankan president expressing parliaments regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation.###yes mr evans i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.###if the house agrees i shall do as mr evans has suggested.###madam president on a point of order.###i would like your advice about rule 000 concerning inadmissibility.###my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again.###the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 0 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.###it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.###i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.###i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report not a legislative proposal and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday.###that is precisely the time when you may if you wish raise this question i.e. on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.###madam president coinciding with this year s first partsession of the european parliament a date has been set unfortunately for next thursday in texas in america for the execution of a young 00 yearold man who has been sentenced to death.###we shall call him mr hicks.###at the request of a french member mr zimeray a petition has already been presented which many people signed including myself.###however i would ask you in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community to make representations using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent to the president and to the governor of texas mr bush who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.###this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.###thank you mr segni i shall do so gladly.###indeed it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted.###madam president i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest.###it is the case of alexander nikitin.###all of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in russia too access to environmental information is a constitutional right.###now however he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.###we know and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed including specifically during the last plenary partsession of last year that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for alexander nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.###these findings form the basis of the european programmes to protect the barents sea and that is why i would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make parliaments position as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted clear as far as russia is concerned.###yes mrs schroedter i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter.###madam president i would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that during this first partsession of the new year the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.###but madam president my personal request has not been met.###although there are now two finnish channels and one portuguese one there is still no dutch channel which is what i had requested because dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.###i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well.###mrs plooijvan gorsel i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors meeting on wednesday.###it will i hope be examined in a positive light.###madam president can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes.###why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were

vicepresident mrs de palacio which appeared in a spanish newspaper.###the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous partsession.###i would ask that they reconsider since this is not the case.###the questions answered previously referred to mrs de palacio s intervention on another occasion and not to these comments which appeared in the abc newspaper on 00 november.###mr berenguer fuster we shall check all this.###i admit that at present the matter seems to be somewhat confused.###we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.###madam president i should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from parliament this week about our discontent over todays decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia considering that the vast majority in this parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past.###todays decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.###so parliament should send a message since that is the wish of the vast majority.###it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo.###as people have said the situation there is extremely volatile.###there is in fact a risk of a military coup in the future.###we do not know what is happening.###so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people.###in any event this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday.###agenda###the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 00 january pursuant to rule 000 of the rules of procedure.###no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday.###relating to wednesday###the group of the party of european socialists requests that a commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the commission.###i would like mr barn crespo who made the request to speak to propose it.###that is if he so wishes of course.###then we shall follow the usual procedure hearing one speaker in favour and one against.###madam president the presentation of the prodi commission s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the group of the party of european socialists which was unanimously approved by the conference of presidents in september and which was also explicitly accepted by president prodi who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.###this commitment is important because the commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaties and therefore basically dictates this parliament s political and legislative activity for the next five years.###i would also like to point out madam president that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature.###it did so again during this legislature in july and then in september it voted once more to approve the whole commission.###there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.###to this end i would like to remind you of the resolution of 00 september which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.###the events of last week  which originated outside the conference of presidents that conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere  present us with a dilemma.###either the commission is not ready to present this programme in which case it should clarify it.###according to its president it is in a position to do so.###given that the commission is represented by vicepresident de palacio i believe that before voting it would help if the commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme as agreed.###alternatively parliament is not ready to examine this programme as some appear to be suggesting.###in my opinion this second hypothesis would imply the failure of parliament in its duty as a parliament as well as introducing an original thesis an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware in writing of a speech concerning the commission s programme a week earlier  and not a day earlier as had been agreed  bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in february so we could forego the debate since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the internet and parliament will no longer have to worry about it.###my group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen debate and reflect there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that if the commission is ready to do so we still have time to reestablish the original agreement between parliament and the commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.###therefore the proposal of the group of the party of european socialists and which you have mentioned is that the prodi commission present its legislative programme on wednesday including its proposed administrative reform because otherwise we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation on the pretext that there is no text on the one hand the president of the commission would be denied his right to speak in this parliament and on the other hand there would be a debate on a reform when parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.###therefore madam president i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.###applause from the pse group###madam president i really am quite astonished at mr barn crespo s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on wednesdays agenda.###mr barn crespo you were unable to attend the conference of presidents last thursday.###i am not criticising this it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them.###mr hnsch represented you on this occasion.###in the conference of presidents we had an indepth discussion.###your group was alone in advocating what you are saying now.###we then put it to a vote.###as you know each chairman has the same number of votes as his group has members.###there was a vote on this matter.###as i recall the outcome of this vote was 000 votes to 000 with a few abstentions.###this means that all the groups with the exception of the nonattached members  but of course they are not a group  were in agreement only your group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here.###all of the others were of a different opinion.###that was the decision.###i should now like to comment on the issue itself.###we have confidence in the commission and in romano prodi and after a difficult procedure as everyone knows the vast majority of our group supported the vote of confidence in romano prodi and the commission.###we believe however that the commissions strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the european parliament but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the commission and which describes this programme over the fiveyear period.###there is no such document.###the commission will present its programme for the year 0000 in february.###we have said very well if the commission does not wish to introduce the 0000 programme as early as january then we will do it in february.###we have agreed to this.###after all we do not wish to quarrel with the commission if at all possible we believe that the commission and parliament need to tread the same path.###however we in parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the commission.###i should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the fiveyear programme in our groups.###you cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this house and have no idea of its content.###that is why we would recommend  and it is my impression that the commission is also open to this idea  that we hold the debate on the commissions longterm programme up to the year 0000 in february  and i hope that the commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us  and that at the same time in february we also hold the debate on the commissions legislative programme for the year 0000.###the fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together.###that is why my group firmly rejects the proposal made by the socialist group.###applause from the ppede group###madam president i would like to make it very clear that above all the commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this parliament and amongst those the decision establishing its agenda.###we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide.###but i would also like to make it very clear that president prodi made a commitment to this parliament to introduce a new debate as mr barn crespo has reminded us which would be in addition to the annual debate on the commission s legislative programme on the broad areas of action for the next five years that is to say for this legislature.###madam president i would like to say that the agreement reached in september distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the commission s legislative programme.###i would also like to say that the commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.###therefore madam president i would like to repeat that the commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and when parliament decides  this week if that is the decision  we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and next month the programme for 0000 which is what we fully agreed upon.###i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.###parliament rejected the request president.###still on the subject of wednesday s sitting i have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.###the ppede group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.###is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this.###madam president i can hear a ripple of laughter from the socialists.###i was told that large sections of the socialist group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda because at the vote in the conference of presidents no vote was received from the working group of members of the socialist group responsible for this matter.###i do not know whether this information is correct but the ppede group would in any case be grateful if this item were removed because parliament has addressed this issue several times already.###decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.###that is why my group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.###thank you mr poettering.###we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request.###madam president i would firstly like to point out mr poettering s lack of logic.###he has just been preaching to the group of the party of european socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the conference of presidents and now he is doing just the same.###we discussed that matter and we were unanimous with the exception of the ppe and eldr groups.###as my fellow chairmen will recall i even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the tobin tax but of whether one dared to hear what the commission and the council thought of it.###it is not a lot to ask.###i therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the commission and the council should be retained so that we can find out once and for all the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the seattle conference.###we shall proceed to vote on the ppede group s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.###parliament rejected the request with 000 votes for 000 votes against and 0 abstentions###madam president i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate.###thank you very much.###madam president has my vote been counted.###i was unable to vote electronically since i do not have a card.###my vote was in favour .###indeed if we add the two members who have declared themselves then the result of the vote would be ....###madam president the presidency has already declared the result of the vote.###there is no room for amendments.###ladies and gentlemen once again we see it is essential for members to bring their voting cards along on a monday.###clearly there is a problem here.###that being the case i shall have to make a decision.###i too forgot my card and i would have voted against.###i therefore consider that the oral question may be kept on the agenda as per the vote.###this is the last time that we shall make allowances for members who have forgotten their cards.###let that be clearly noted and understood.###applausethe oral question will therefore remain on the agenda and yes your president is entitled to vote just as she is entitled to forget her voting card.###we shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda.###madam president in the earlier vote  and i will abide by your ruling on this matter  on the question of the strategic plan of the commission i indicated that i would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my group.###that did not happen.###i would appreciate it if on the close of this item of business i might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group.###this is an important matter.###it would be useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.###madam president i do not wish to reopen the debate but i had also asked for the floor to comment on mr barn crespos motion.###you did not call me either.###i regret this but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.###i am terribly sorry mr hnsch and mr cox.###i did not see you asking to speak.###even so i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes.###when we adopt the minutes for today s sitting tomorrow then any members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.###this seems to me to be a workable solution.###of course the minutes for tomorrow s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.###i think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely timeconsuming explanations of votes.###mr cox mr hnsch would this be acceptable to you.###madam president if the vote records correctly how my group voted i shall not and cannot object to that.###if your ruling is that i cannot give an explanation of vote i accept that but with reservations.###we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes as we always do of course.###if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted then we may correct them if necessary.###the order of business was adopted thus amended###safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods###the next item is the report a000000000 by mr koch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterways c000000000  00000000cod.###commissioner madam president ladies and gentlemen i can be quite frank in saying that i welcome the councils common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway.###firstly we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of directive 0000ec which obliges the member states to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.###secondly by adopting this directive we achieve a an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped b a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c equal opportunities for safety advisers on the european labour market.###thirdly this directive as it currently stands in the common position guarantees  in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards  a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the european union by adopting it we contribute to the member states bearing a high level of individual responsibility.###all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.###our amendments from the first reading have i believe been taken into account very satisfactorily.###they have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance or they have been rejected because the corresponding european arrangements have not been included for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.###the one unanimously adopted amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive is something which i would urge you to support.###by not setting a specific date for the member states to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.###i would urge you to endorse this.###madam president we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads but also on our railways and waterways not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because  as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles  a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.###as an austrian i still have a vivid memory as i believe we all do of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the tauern tunnel where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.###the renovation project which lasted for months cut off this important route between the north and south of europe.###the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit.###in fact all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.###prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards welltrained safety advisers being available so that the right action is taken in good time.###all the same we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety.###we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the member states in good time and  even more importantly  we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.###please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.###i should like to address one final point.###we must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that where transport safety in europe is concerned there is still much more to be done.###in this context i should like to make a request and ask the commissioner responsible who is with us here today to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future so that we in europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.###madam president first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which has at its heart the issue of transport safety.###the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road rail and inland waterway.###i congratulate him on his excellent report.###transport safety has sadly been in the news recently the paddington rail crash in london the terrible rail crash in norway the two aviation crashes involving eu citizens and the natural disaster involving the erika off brittany  all within the last four months  remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.###the rapporteur has pointed out to the house that in its common position the council has accepted six of parliaments ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of parliaments other amendments has been retained.###my group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the european union as safe as possible.###when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.###we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.###madam president i would like to make a few comments.###i would like first of all to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and secondly the commission for the proposal it has submitted.###we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also in fact with minimum requirements.###this is a pity in a sense.###needless to say safety on roads railways and inland waterways is of key importance and given the international nature of these types of transport training for safety advisors should also be harmonised therefore as well as the requirements of the new adr for example which is under way.###this is important but so is enforcement and there are of course a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.###just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years for example in belgium the netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.###or ships from eastern europe which moor adjacent to ships over here with all the obvious risks that this entails.###furthermore it has transpired that research in the ports in belgium finland but also in japan has shown that 00 of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.###in short the issue is an important one.###if we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 0 january of this year.###there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present especially with smaller companies as these cannot afford safety advisors.###these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo which causes problems.###it is therefore also being requested that iso 0000 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.###the work is done.###all that remains is the business of enforcement.###i would like to mention one final point.###with regard to enforcement proper agreements must also be concluded with the eastern european countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 0 july 0000 that is to say in eighteen months time.###this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.###this is not in itself anything dreadful but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road rail and inland waterways and incorporate these as part of the acquis communautaire as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.###madam president the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so.###the ever increasing volume of goods passing through europe entails all kinds of risks known and unknown for employees and the social environment.###those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.###the relevant standards which have been laid down in another directive 0000ec seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.###i am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the council on minimum standards regarding examinations although i would have preferred it if uniform set standards and modules had been established so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.###this however does not seem feasible.###finally the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can therefore give it my wholehearted support.###mr president commissioner i should first like to congratulate mr koch on his reports which though technical are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.###i should like to make just a few comments.###firstly i should like to ask the commissioner  and i am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground  to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety be it on the roads on the waterways or at sea.###considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a commission proposal first made on 00 march 0000 even though parliament responded relatively quickly this time lag is a little too long.###this is not just the fault of the commission but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.###my second point has already been mentioned it concerns the minimum standards.###in principle i believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and countryspecific rules.###however when it comes to safety i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden for example is in principle no different from safety in germany italy or austria.###i can live with these minimum standards but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully.###should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.###my third point has also been mentioned already.###as you know like mr rack i come from a transit country where this issue plays a particularly important role.###we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as austria or other transit countries.###but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum in all countries whether they are transit countries or not.###mr president i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur mr koch on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway.###we understand that it is important that the two institutions  parliament and commission  cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the committee on regional policy and in particular the transport group is magnificent.###the common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and at second reading we can accept the amendment on the proposed date which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the commission bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.###very briefly i would like to thank the various members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the commission s priorities in the field of transport.###as mr simpson has said very correctly this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.###the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.###in this regard i would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels which messrs rack and swoboda have referred to which in the case of austria is doubtless a very sensitive issue and great effort should be made to improve their safety.###in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.###margarine and a few kilos of paint which in principle do not present risks led to a genuine disaster.###therefore we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.###finally i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.###this week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport in light of the erika disaster and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.###but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission.###as i will say in the debate on the erika disaster we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.###i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur mr koch.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###transport of dangerous goods by road###the next item is the report a000000000 by mr koch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 0000ec on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road com0000 000  c000000000  00000000cod.###mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road which entered into force on 0 january 0000 contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the cen that is the european committee for standardisation.###delays in the cen s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.###in particular annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.###i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.###in this respect i accept this proposal to amend directive 0000ec which has been tabled for discussion today.###should the european union fail to take action then member states would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period until the cen completes its work which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.###the amendment to the directive on todays agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community.###it merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines deletes provisions which are no longer applicable and lays down the procedures for a carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b enacting less stringent national regulations in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.###the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity the member states obtain more powers.###the commission decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own.###in so doing it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.###the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down afresh in the council decision of june 0000.###the proposal to be discussed today to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road dates from may 0000 however and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.###two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.###we would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the council has to make a decision  which is not clearly worded  is set at a maximum of three months.###in addition the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.###a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements in particular for vacuum tanks if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below 00c.###this is in the special interest of northern european regions.###a final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 0 january 0000 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.###i do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety but i would ask you to endorse this report.###mr president colleagues a happy new year and millennium to you all.###i am speaking for the first time in this plenary partsession so this is quite exciting for me a little like first love although that did last longer than two minutes.###i would like to briefly comment on the commission s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.###it is good that this directive should be established now as otherwise member states would have to amend their national acts for a very short time a period of transition which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to eu bureaucracy.###the commission s proposal however does not take account of all the facts such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.###consequently i have tabled some amendments to mr koch s intrinsically excellent report which have been adopted by our committee.###my amendments concern the frostresistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.###according to the commission s proposal 00c would have been sufficient.###on the shores of the mediterranean it is hard to imagine that in lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.###there is support for the eu in lapland also so let us remember them.###i have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to 00c.###this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.###i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow s vote.###mr president with your permission i should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.###i thought that it was quite superb.###on the subject at hand i think that the people of europe must be able to be confident that the goods  however dangerous they are  which are transported on europes roads railways and so on are as safe as possible.###this directive is a contribution to this.###what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.###the rapporteur mr koch to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the cen which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.###that is why we can only hope  and we should resolve all of this this week  that in 0000 we will finally have community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.###commissioner mr president i would first like to thank mr koch for his excellent report which i do not have a great deal to add to.###i would like to take the opportunity just to point out that the transport of dangerous goods continues to cause major problems not just in india where i have just come from but also within the eu.###we only have to think of the serious accident in the mont blanc tunnel about a year ago not to mention the one in the tauern tunnel.###we observe that there is always a possibility of major problems of this kind occurring where nature gives rise to troublesome phenomena such as mist storms or cold weather particularly in the narrow alpine passes.###in general i would urge that the transport of dangerous goods is transferred more to rail.###in this context when planning future railway tracks or motorways a preventative approach should be taken and the appropriate longterm solution built into the process early on.###i would remind you of the brenner base tunnel which has not been touched on even indirectly.###while i am on the subject i would also like to point out that transport problems are one of the key issues facing the eu and call on the commission to give due attention to this.###we need to have much more probing and vigorous debate on cuttingdown on transport heavy rail traffic road pricing and railway privatisation with a view to improving functionality.###considering that enlargement towards the east will create a few more problems then it becomes clear to us all that the future credibility of the eu will depend on whether and in what manner we succeed in sorting out the transport situation.###mr president the report we are discussing here does not in itself entail any major changes.###most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.###it is nonetheless worth emphasising that each time we make this type of decision it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.###very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu both on roads and railways and by sea.###this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.###in area after area we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states.###this is extraordinarily positive and there is cause to thank the rapporteur mr koch for the work he has put in on this issue.###this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.###if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also as far as possible apply to every country.###i should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance namely an amendment tabled by member of parliament mr ari vatanen.###in many ways the prerequisites differ from one member state to another.###by approving this amendment we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union.###this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.###it is good that in establishing the present regulations we can also be flexible.###i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment.###mr president i would like to thank not only mr koch but also the vicepresident of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.###the reason mr koch produced his sound report was because the work in the cen and within the united nations economic commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.###i would like to ask the vicepresident if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations and whether the eu is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.###for one thing is clear even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the european union traffic does not stop at our borders it goes beyond them.###hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more farreaching regional provisions.###if the commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the cen and the economic commission are at.###mr president i would once again like to congratulate mr koch on his magnificent work on this other report which in a way supplements the debate which we held in october on rail transport.###we all regret that the european committee for standardisation cen has not been able in the required time to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the european union.###this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this europe of ours.###a moment ago mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures not of 00 degrees below zero but of 00 degrees below zero.###of course we accept that amendment  it is absolutely right  and i believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the european union which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.###i would like to say with regard to mr swoboda s comments on the activity of the cen that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if despite the new deadline we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.###lastly mr president the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out.###we have referred to the delay by the cen the amendment of certain provisions the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.###the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur mr koch which are contained in the various amendments specifically four.###we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###structural funds  cohesion fund coordination###the next item is the report a000000000 by mrs schroedter on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the communication from the commission in the field of the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund guidelines for programmes in the period 00000000 com0000000  c000000000  00000000cos.###mr president commissioner ah now i see commissioner fischler is here and there i was thinking that you would not be coming.###welcome to parliament.###ladies and gentlemen we cannot overlook the fact that the benefits of the european internal market are reaped most of all by the wealthy regions and even there they are not enjoyed by all sections of the population.###how long do we actually intend to allow this kind of development to go on for resulting as it does in the widening gulf between poor and wealthy regions.###whilst in the fifth report on the situation in the regions unemployment was seven times higher in the poor regions than in the wealthy regions the sixth report is already talking in terms of it being eight times higher despite the fact that european structural funds are pouring into the regions.###hence it will of course come as no surprise to anyone that the very preamble to the new structural funds regulation places great emphasis on the call for the funds to be implemented more efficiently and in a more concentrated manner in order to achieve the european objectives of high employment levels and sustainable development to name but a few.###parliament but above all the member states demanded massive improvements.###this was very soon forgotten however when the commission developed the new instrument for the purpose the guidelines and wanted to make the requirement for there to be efficiency concentration and simplification of administration in the implementation of the european structural funds more binding.###subsequently the member state governments referred to the principle of subsidiarity and just wanted to get their hands on the money.###and so all that remained of the 0000 berlin summit was the indicative nature of the guidelines.###however this at least places the commission under the obligation to approve only those programmes that will actually enable european objectives to be achieved.###i may have my doubts as to whether this indicative instrument will actually succeed in achieving efficiency and increased concentration and in actually putting the european objectives into practice but it is a fact that the guidelines will be of central importance to the negotiations for the community development programme.###if you want our work at european level to be taken seriously then you must also take it seriously yourselves.###parliament was not in a position to go into the content of the guidelines because it was not consulted until the legislative period was long since past.###now that the programming phases are so far on there is little point in starting from scratch again.###that is why in my report i concentrate on the strategic nature of the instrument with the blessing of the committee.###firstly the report assesses the impact of the instrument per se.###secondly it uncovers the shortcomings in the commission document.###for example the question of partnership was simply left out of the central part of the structural funds.###one searches the document in vain for the central principle which calls upon the member states to see that programmes are implemented at local level in conjunction not only with the local authorities and regions but also with local actors business and social organisations ngos unions employers associations women s organisations citizens initiatives and employment initiatives.###the question as to why it was left out has not been answered to date.###parliament makes demands here that are of central importance.###it expects the commission to only approve those programmes established on the basis of partnerships of this kind.###it surprised me members of the conservative group to suddenly find that amendments aimed at dropping the decentralising approach had been produced overnight.###all i can say is try taking this to your regions and explaining to your electorate why the european principle of decentralisation is not to be put into practice in the regions.###let me tell you you will not escape from that one unscathed.###we cannot have a situation where we agree principles in this house and when it comes to implementing them everyone does their own thing again.###incidentally i would just like to address a comment to the government of my country where there is a desire simply to ignore the horizontal community policy concerning environmental protection and where it was maintained that there was no need to implement the ffh guideline.###i believe it is a good thing that the commission is holding firm here.###this brings me to my final point.###the guidelines must serve as the hard and fast criteria we use to assess whether article 0 of the regulation is actually being implemented.###i expect the commission to ensure that the guidelines which certainly allow for adequate flexibility are in every sense the benchmark for the negotiations.###we represent the european position.###in other words sustainability in transport policy must be taken into account every bit as much as the entitlement of women to a share of financial support as must the fact that each programme should make provision for the overall contribution thus enabling there to be sustainable urban development and truly model projects in rural areas.###this is what i expect the outcome of the community development programmes to be and i do not expect you to give way on this again.###how else otherwise do we propose to reduce the unemployment rate.###not by continuing to wait and trying to cheat our way through again.###we cannot wait.###in a few years time we will no longer be able to spend so much money on implementing european structural policy because a great many more countries will be joining us and then we will have no choice but to create much improved more efficient and more concentrated structures.###and that will only be the beginning.###i therefore expect the commission to take parliament s demands seriously in the course of the negotiations and to actually put the european position into practice here giving a progressive regional policy a chance at long last.###mr president it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the european parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the united kingdom that i represent in this parliament namely wales.###a major part of wales as you know has been granted objective 0 status under the structural funds programme.###it is quite clear that many people within wales are looking to the european structural funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.###we have seen poverty growing in wales and growing still further since 0000.###we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.###we are looking therefore within the structural funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the principality.###what is however deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of structural funds assistance is something that has been in a sense a success of the government.###it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces.###that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront.###we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.###we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures.###we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.###we look to it to challenge the uk government to ensure that the private sector which surely must be providing the major impetus for structural funds expenditure is involved in the planning stage.###finally we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.###too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent.###this is one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wales.###mr president our committee views these issues very differently and to start i will speak from the point of view of research.###we see it as a very positive sign that in her own conclusions the rapporteur has taken account of our committee s proposal that the cohesion fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.###this will be possible with action on the part of governments and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.###another matter we would like to address specifically from the point of view of industrial policy is that we would have liked the commission to pay more attention to the effects of services electronic commerce and the growing use of the internet when they were planning the coordination of structural funds and cohesion funds.###poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.###the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry but today those areas might have become a burden and they may well be poor meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production as i might call it and the production of services because they are the industries of the future.###in my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this so on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research and energy i would draw the commission s attention to this issue.###finally as the committee representing energy we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from cohesion and regional development funds to have been emphasised still more thus through a process of coordination increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.###mr president i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that i am speaking for my colleague mrs flautre who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill.###i would like to draw peoples attention to amendments nos 0 and 0 which were agreed by the committee on employment and social affairs but not accepted by the committee on regional policy transport and tourism.###these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.###in the past this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.###these amendments also fit in with this parliaments view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.###we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.###in her report mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking yet desperately needed.###the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund.###but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 00000000 programme.###it could be said that the omission gives the impression that the commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between european social fund assistance which is subject to review after three and a half years and the member states annual national plans for employment.###we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.###mr president commissioner the proposal presented by the commission in accordance with its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development.###i would like to point out however that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us maintaining a population in rural areas given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.###this as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.###the consequences do not inspire hope.###it is the young people who are disappearing who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.###this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.###we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union.###agriculture only provides 0.0 of employment in the union.###furthermore three quarters of our farm workers are parttime and require supplements to their incomes.###for this reason one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the european union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside of the agricultural sector in sectors such as rural tourism sport culture heritage conservation the conversion of businesses new technologies services etc.###however even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive it is still essential not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.###therefore we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set.###we want rural areas at the dawn of the 00st century to be competitive and multifunctional both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of nonagricultural activities.###it is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium and to bear in mind the conclusions of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the five fundamental issues which have been only partly taken up by the committee on transport regional policy and tourism in its points 00 and 00.###in conclusion i would ask the commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because i believe that for the european union maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.###mr president commissioner i would like to begin by thanking mrs schroedter the rapporteur for her work.###i think that this work has been carried out extremely well.###i would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments  and perhaps there are more of them than we expected  but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.###we feel that it is important that the commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this parliament at least in spirit because at this stage it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise and nothing but hot air.###the truth of the matter though is that we believe  and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted  that the commission must take account of what is adopted by this parliament particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.###in our amendments we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the structural funds the cohesion fund and community initiatives so that their application should be reflected in the best and most profitable way by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are when all is said and done the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.###in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives we think that those who generate employment the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment that is businesspeople must participate in this initiative.###small and mediumsized businesses above all need to take part in the distribution of these funds.###if they do not if businesspeople feel marginalised if entrepreneurs cannot take part not only in managing but also in receiving these funds we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.###also in order to attain our objectives to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.###all of this must be done  i repeat  with the participation of private business which by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations but complementing them never obstructing or excluding them will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.###mr president it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague mr evans of why wales actually achieved objective 0 status.###it was because of the discredited policies of his own conservative party.###let me also remind him that when his party leader mr hague was secretary of state for wales he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from commissioner wulfmathies regarding regulatory requirements.###i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective 0 additionality.###i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation.###my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.###i want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.###the objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional lifesupport machine.###it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hitech sector.###it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that europe is rapidly losing ground to the us in the hitech growth industries of the future.###the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.###they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.###they should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development resulting in inevitable delays and underspends particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.###the implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer either in the commission or in the civil service.###there must be an internal coherence in the commission directorate while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes.###the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fundusers and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.###if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence which will be the key to future success.###this is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines whether eu regional policy with a good solid enabling guideline can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the eu.###mr president commissioner i would like to thank mrs schroedter for an excellent report.###she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.###the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.###we are badly behind now in this matter.###hopefully the stands parliament has taken will help however in the midterm appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.###for the time the report grew too large when it was being debated.###it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.###at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer union regional policy bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.###our group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity the responsibility of member states and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.###it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.###our group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.###we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the union and its member states exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.###projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.###funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.###projects have to be carried out more efficiently more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.###while the report was being prepared it was interesting to discuss the union s regional policy in general.###for us new members it was the first time and this was a very interesting process.###this report is very good and our group supports it.###mr president commissioner as proof that this parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution the excellent report by a fellow member of my group elisabeth schroedter has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 00000000 for objective 0 regions have been sitting in the commission s offices for several months.###bearing this in mind this house should in any event demand that before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved they be studied and submitted for debate in this parliament specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.###this is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and leastdeveloped regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards a fairer europe.###mr president we should not forget that the main strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.###we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.###we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a europe of citizens and not just in a europe of states and of regions.###we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.###we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.###some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.###we will have to study several indicators which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others and how they are evolving.###it is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to parliament s plenary sitting today that europe s 00 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 00 least prosperous regions.###this fact means that the european parliament the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically.###i agree that the european parliament did not have the opportunity  or that it was not given the opportunity as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term  to discuss the directives.###i do not think however that this report has come too late.###we need to consider it together so that the new objective 0 programmes and the plans for regional development which have been drafted before the directives come into force can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.###we all agree that we should ask that halfway through these programmes when the assessment of the directives is made parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens representatives.###our citizens cannot accept that the european union takes decisions in a way that is at least on the face of it bureaucratic.###they need to see the political dimension working to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.###this is what we are today asking the commissioner for.###i would like to think that given his previous experience as a regional president he will agree to propose indicators and a strategy which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.###mr president i support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the period 00000000 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of eu structural and cohesion funds.###this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.###member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.###this latter point is of particular importance.###while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.###we do not want to build a europe of cities alone.###the structural funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries mainly through the upgrading of roads water treatment and related transport networks.###this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary partsession.###key eu programmes between 0000 0000 0000 and 0000 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 0 regions within europe.###the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date.###this would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions the poorer regions in europe are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone as well as within an everexpanding internal market where the free movement of goods persons services and capital exist.###in conclusion while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the european regional development fund and the cohesion fund we should remember that the european social fund has played a very important role in helping the less welloff in our society.###the social fund has certainly improved our thirdlevel institutions financed our postleaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and longterm unemployment assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.###mr president on numerous occasions in the past i have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues.###this time however i actually agree with her.###whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path i cannot say.###nevertheless i would like to commend her on her work.###the second point i would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex as we and mrs mccarthy as rapporteurs for the general regulation had asked.###unfortunately this did not happen.###mr berni is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.###i am raising the issue just to reiterate parliament s position.###thirdly we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.###they are particularly beneficial to the member states and i would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development job creation and more particularly on equal opportunities and transport issues.###personally i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.###as an islander however i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.###this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves.###this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament and i have raised the issue time and time again.###commissioner we shall continue to raise the issue as article 000 paragraph 0 of the treaty of amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.###therefore the commission should address the issue once and for all.###the time has come to implement the programmes and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.###as for us in parliament i would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which was signed in may.###i am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.###mr president commissioner in this minute and a half i should like first of all to congratulate mrs schroedter.###i know many have already done so but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides and i think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.###i share the regrets she expressed namely that parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that i cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect which in my view is a pity.###consequently i feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the midterm review in 0000 and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 0000.###in brief i would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 00000000 which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.###the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.###subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.###we must ask ourselves a fundamental question how can we ensure that union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development.###the second challenge is that of enlargement which will of course have a considerable impact both in budgetary and geographical terms.###these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us.###finally in this time of natural disasters i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds.###as you know it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation.###europe should not be completely absent as the states tend to want.###public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.###i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.###i also think we should ensure or ask member states to ensure that there is some publicity given to european aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.###mr president the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.###as far as french planning experts are concerned for example the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.###well the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.###our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.###its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds.###what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at european level.###the commission however though bound to issue guidelines does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.###the report put forward today reestablishes its place in the political sphere.###it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.###this is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.###mr president i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.###over the coming years faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement europe will more than ever before require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.###to this end europe as a whole and each member state individually will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities including the structural funds.###for this to be possible what we need from the european commission are not just good intentions but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the member states.###for example in recent years italy has had problems in utilising the structural funds mainly because of excessive bureaucracy insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.###there are therefore two points to which i would like to draw the commission s attention.###firstly we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decisionmaking precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.###secondly a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent since they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated to the point of hindering access to the funds.###this is something about which european small and mediumsized businesses in particular tend to complain.###i will conclude mr president by saying that the failure of the commission s communication to focus on territorial pacts and especially methods of combating unemployment among women and young people is cause for serious concern.###mr president like my colleague mr evans it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue especially since i represent a part of the united kingdom the west midlands which has hitherto benefited from objective 0 funding in particular.###but the report before the house tonight is a prime example of how if we are not very careful we can produce very grandiosesounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.###the report itself is wellintentioned but as so often when we deal with these issues lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.###that is why i and my group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text not to take anything away from the proposal but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.###i would like to explain our thinking here.###firstly we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds.###past experience dictates that as the elected representatives of the european taxpayer we should and indeed must demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as value for money indicators in the grantgiving process.###next we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.###but at the midway point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.###our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer but we also avoid the wellrehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.###finally we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.###there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.###also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from smallscale revenuebased projects which are hard to monitor towards capital schemes where in the majority of cases the benefits are there for all to see.###that way the muchtrumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the european parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.###if these changes to the report are supported by the house today i believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about namely to assist  in a financially sustainable manner  those deprived areas of the european union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living not by giving a handout but by giving a handup.###i urge the house to support these changes.###mr president commissioner i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.###the european union s structural and cohesion policies are without doubt essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.###despite the steps taken thus far these levels are still very high and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.###these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thoughtout and sensible guidelines.###let us not forget that when these policies are effective they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life.###let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the european union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development unless of course the commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the european mainland.###in closing i would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium for which we all hope for the best.###mr president mrs schroedter s report undoubtedly contains several important observations and i would like to congratulate her on that.###however i feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community s regional policy.###quite briefly structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way rather it aggravates it.###the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers particularly in the south.###regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states.###if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.###little consideration if any at all has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure transport communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.###the union s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.###a large section of the union s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grassroots.###unfortunately the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.###mr president i would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the union.###the first is the fundamental central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.###we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously.###we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union s fundamental objectives.###secondly i agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and i would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.###in future we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as in my country the islands of the azores and madeira.###i would like to ask if the commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the commission s report on the outermost regions which has been long awaited by parliament.###mr president first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.###mr president commissioner the guidelines are intended to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.###however contrary to their claim to provide guidance the commission s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.###nonetheless their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.###i agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the member states on simplifying administration and i support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labourintensive small and mediumsized enterprises on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing and on startup help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.###i am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my group to paragraph 00 to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.###i should be very grateful mrs schroedter if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.###mr president commissioner in the committee on employment and social affairs we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the structural and cohesion funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.###unfortunately the excellent schroedter report did not take account of this criterion despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show  as we shall see later in the berend report  how in fact these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from europe s most highlydeveloped regions.###they are growing but only in terms of gdp.###they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.###commissioner please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs and treat it as a matter of priority because this is our citizens greatest problem.###please take account in strategic terms in the revision and in the allocation of reserves of employment needs because this fundamentally is what the structural funds and the cohesion funds require.###mr president it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial sevenyear period 00000000 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation particularly for women and young people and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.###it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas employment in rural areas aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the european union and for the greek islands which of course comprise half of the islands of the union as stipulated in article 000 of the treaty.###cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.###mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to mrs schroedter s report.###everyone understands mrs schroedter ladies and gentlemen the reasons and the time limits involved  and i shall come back to this point presently  and whatever the time limits or delays since we are discussing this report right now as the representative for the commission i consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 00000000 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.###mrs schroedter you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the member states and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters european union cofinancing of the programmes requires and is the justification for a situation where community priorities as debated and approved in this house should also be taken into account in order to promote this community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.###so ladies and gentlemen i should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you mrs schroedter and the various members of this house have made.###regarding the role and structure of these guidelines mr hatzidakis mrs schroedter and mrs mccarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of structural fund objectives 0 0 and 0 as well as their links with the cohesion funds.###this means putting forward the commission s priorities based on past experience in implementing the programmes as well as current community policies relating to structural operations.###the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use to the optimum and efficient use as some of you have wished of community involvement including mr bradbourn using if necessary the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monies.###when i speak of optimum utilisation i am referring both to the national and regional levels.###and so mr seppnen i shall also mention at this point speaking of the national level the link with the cohesion fund.###this is the purpose of these guidelines.###regarding their content as you know ladies and gentlemen of this house they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but at the same time very passionately as i understood her presentation just now.###the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create in all sectors but especially in the private sector as mr berend said the maximum number of serious worthwhile and permanent jobs the competitiveness of regional economies all regional economies and in particular mr evans that of wales but not only of wales.###and because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission let me also add the regional economies of the european regions handicapped by their distance from the centre be they remote regions island regions or of course the most remote regions which are naturally the most distant.###perhaps i may inform mr ribeiro e castro who asked me about this that as i wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions the commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.###concerning the most remote regions it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments but this is not necessarily an excuse just an explanation.###we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.###i myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 00 november and within the college we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions.###i would thank you for your understanding in this matter.###so that is the first priority the competitiveness of regional economies.###the second priority which several of you have stressed mr puerta in particular but there were others not that i am mentioning them in any order of priority is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.###ladies and gentlemen we now have a european union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great proving the effectiveness and worth of the cohesion fund but where at the same time in relation to unemployment  as you wrote mrs schroedter  an increasing gap exists between the 00 or 00 richest regions and the 00 or 00 poorest or most disadvantaged regions.###this is a situation which is as it should be unjustifiable and intolerable.###as far as i am concerned  taking into account my own concept of the construction of europe and regional development policy in particular  this is a situation which i find unacceptable and i have every intention as far as possible with your support of dedicating all the appropriations for which i am responsible to this improved social human and territorial cohesion particularly in order to prevent what i once called in this house a twospeed europe a europe of wealthy districts but at the same time a europe of impoverished areas.###the third objective is urban and rural development within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.###in fact the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account.###the first is rural development and let me say mrs schroedter that i am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport an issue i have been involved in personally for a long time.###i particularly remember the time when i was minister for the environment in my own country.###the second principle is that of equal opportunities particularly for men and women as well as the european strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary union.###finally and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this house particularly yourself mrs schroedter in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies for development or redevelopment which of all the priorities offer the maximum opportunity to synergy to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership.###you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership yet there is a clear reference to it on page 0 of the guidelines.###however i do wish to mention  since you have asked me to do so  that as far as i am concerned this partnership  and i spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely  is a tool one used to involve local brainpower be it in the public sector in the form of elected representatives the social and educational sectors associations or in the private sector a decentralised partnership and let me mention in this connection in response to mrs angelilli the territorial pacts which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.###these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities since they must be taken into consideration under each of the objectives to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the member states and regions.###i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made ladies and gentlemen and firstly on procedure.###it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date.###let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the commission in the form of a draft in february 0000 in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text my predecessor mrs wulfmathies presented them to parliament immediately.###due to the elections to the european parliament taking place around this time however parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted in july 0000.###here in this chamber ladies and gentlemen among you i wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning  mr hatzidakis asked me a question about this  as far as member states are concerned your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.###and let me assure you furthermore that when the commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the midterm review in mind in line with the regulations then the point of view of this house as expressed in this report will also be taken into account.###now to the form.###on the subject of the role of the guidelines mrs schroedter you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives often very precise ones should be provided.###i shall not list them all but they include implementing intersectoral policies increasing efficiency in the use of public funds assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together etc.###the commission takes note of these but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents such as the guide to the reform of the structural funds or the methodological working document.###drawing to a close i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated mrs schroedter.###i am thinking for example of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.###this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring s negotiations.###the commission kept to the actual text of article 00 of the structural funds regulations which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide member states with broad indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed community policies.###i actually quoted the text itself in quotation marks.###moreover the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.###you then mentioned mrs schroedter the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.###i find the opposite the case.###i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches and shall attach to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.###indeed i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere.###as regards rural development which a number of you brought up particularly mrs redondo jimnez the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas but also protection of the environment and europe s rural heritage.###it must however be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the structural funds whose objectives 0 and 0 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.###and indeed on the subject of the balance of rural society let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the eaggf guarantee section aimed at promoting reform in european agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.###at this stage i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective 0 rural areas in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective 0 regions.###in any event i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter.###before concluding i should like to tell mr savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck france austria and germany in particular in the last few weeks and at the same time we shall once again be discussing together with my fellow commissioner mrs de palacio what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of france.###i shall therefore reserve the right if you permit sir to give you my own opinion which to a great extent matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using objective 0.###i shall remind you that the commission is going to be approving the objective 0 zoning plans for france sweden austria and luxembourg tomorrow.###we shall then have an appropriate tool for working particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.###indeed this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.###in conclusion with thanks for your understanding mr president i should like to thank you mrs schroedter for the quality of your work and that of the committee and to tell you that i am very pleased apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines.###we have discussed this and i have attempted to clarify my point of view.###i am very pleased with the level of support offered by your house to the commission in establishing these guidelines which have been submitted to the member states for information when establishing their own programmes.###this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 00000000 programmes.###i feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions at this time when programming for the period 00000000 is being undertaken good joint working practice which is mr hatzidakis backed up by something i am very attentive to observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union###the next item is the debate on the report a000000000 by mr berend on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union sec000000  c0000000  00000000cos.###mr president commissioner barnier ladies and gentlemen the sixth periodic report contains a comprehensive and detailed description of the economic and social situation in the union s regions and of their development trends and represents as i see it a solid basis for the formulation of structural policy priorities at union level.###the report demonstrates that  measured in terms of gross domestic product per capita  the poorest regions are beginning to catch up and that is how the situation is set to continue.###this can largely be attributed to the structural funds even though the disparity between the poorest and wealthiest regions is still considerable.###employing european structural funds has already enabled convergence in standards of living.###over a ten year period the gap in average gdp has been reduced by ten percent.###this has particularly affected the four cohesion countries  in the positive sense of course  as it has the five former east german lnder.###unfortunately this europeanwide development was due in the main to an increase in productivity and only partly to an increase in the level of employment.###hence we would urge the commission and the member states to give due attention to the effect measures have on employment in future.###the lion s share of the transfer payments has been and still is used for investment in rationalisation and modernisation with the intention of improving labour productivity.###however this has dampened the effect of structural policy on employment.###this is not an assessment but for the moment merely an observation.###the report establishes however that regional differences in the labour market have in fact continued to increase.###unemployment is currently at 00 in 00 of the weakest regions.###ten years ago it was 0 lower i.e. 00.###and i might just mention that in the 00 best regions unemployment averages 0.0 it was 0.0 ten years ago hence there has been an increase of only 0.0.###the report makes clear the fact that 00 of unemployment is structural unemployment.###that is why  and this is the conclusion we can draw from this report  promoting competitiveness within industry and infrastructure for economic activity must be central to the structural policy in that order.###the corollary to this it has to be said is that measures for the retraining and ongoing training of the work force are of no small importance either.###in addition more attention must be given to boosting entrepreneurial potential in small and mediumsized enterprises and the services they call upon must be developed further.###another conclusion to be drawn from the report is that if financial support is to be utilised efficiently then the measures must be brought into line with the broadly diversified means of support intended to establish a middleclass and minimum standard of living.###a very important point to my mind.###in the conclusions of this report we make the commission aware that the legal bases for cooperation between regions and member states and applicant countries must be improved and point to how crucial it is for the budget to be consolidated as a prerequisite to the success of economic and monetary union and enlargement eastwards.###we call upon those member states that have not yet submitted a satisfactory map of development regions to do so immediately and of course we expect the commission to examine with due haste the operational programmes for the regions for the new support period 0000 to 0000 in the light of the results of the sixth periodic report and to do everything possible to enable this support period to commence without delay in those areas where it is needed and in the proper manner.###mr president commissioner this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.###i consider however that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in europe offers a somewhat oversimplified view of the situation and unfortunately this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.###the commission report generally relativises this observation particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the union in which i have a special interest by which i mean the french overseas departments and more generally the most remote regions.###in this respect i am pleased to see that the committee on regional policy transport and tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and more specifically to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new article 0000 of the treaty of amsterdam.###finally in my view this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of europe particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of europe and its more remote regions.###even if the commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the community area through the union s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the sec.###mr president the group of the party of european socialists in this parliament agrees with the report that mr berend has just presented and congratulates the author both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.###it must be remembered that currently the european union s overall competitiveness is in general terms 00 of that of the united states of america and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units that is the regions also improves.###furthermore this is at a time when technological development economic globalisation and our problems which are enlargement and the single currency demand that the regions as well as businesses and individuals make more of an effort to be competitive.###the european commission s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.###i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur one positive and one negative.###the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the union and that the community funds have been a major although not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities.###the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the european regions gdp and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.###it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.###this commissioner is the first commandment for the coming period.###thus mr president i ask my fellow members to approve this report and i ask the commission as other speakers have done to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 00000000.###mr president commissioner i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.###the sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the union s regional policy aims.###the report shows that growth has been uneven despite all our efforts.###very rapid growth is continuing in central europe.###the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general european average whereas many southern european and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.###we now require an indepth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.###is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences long distances climates that are too cold or too hot sparse populations and austere conditions.###how can the union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development.###it is also important to discover what the effects of union enlargement will be on structural funds and the development of the union s more remote areas.###the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility.###some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased.###this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.###in the future we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.###for example uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.###in this connection too weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development.###it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and knowhow.###our group is in favour of adopting this report.###mr president commissioner the european union s regional policy has until now not been able to interpret in any significant way the existing differences in our inhabitants incomes.###we have a serious situation in which in the european union today there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached on average 00.0 in the regions worst affected regions which also happen to be poor areas whilst in the 00 regions with the lowest unemployment corresponding to the richer areas unemployment stands at just 0.###given this situation the report approved by parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes which are often misspent with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the transeuropean rail networks which are due in 0000.###there should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries agriculture and fisheries which are often harmed by the european union s own insensitive policies as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs particularly for women and young people.###only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.###mr president commissioner mr berend s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the european commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.###the overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation boosting equality of opportunity increasing the sustainability of employment and development are only mentioned in passing.###this attitude appears to me to be unjustified.###i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.###this does not mean that i do not see the need for competitiveness particularly as i myself am an entrepreneur in an objective 0 region that is in brandenburg in the federal republic of germany and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and mediumsized enterprises.###it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the objective 0 regions that is to say job creation measures special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.###they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities.###supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development simply because there is no basis for a selfsupporting upturn in these objective 0 regions.###after all the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 0 in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.###concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demandorientated economic policy is not the answer.###and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and to a lesser extent in rationalisation.###it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demandorientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.###the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.###in other words what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.###for example these would be measures for vocational training for further education for reintegrating people who have already been excluded from the production process for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.###mr president my compliments to the rapporteur for his indepth report.###the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union.###by stimulating a diversity of investments the european union is endeavouring to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment.###from the sixth periodic report on the regions one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.###the efforts made in order to drive up the gdp per capita in objective 0 regions do not always result in such an increase not really a satisfying result over a period during which certainly over the past couple of years there has been economic growth.###as indicated by the rapporteur the effects of the structural measures on the other hand are minimal as far as employment is concerned.###some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for.###also the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.###mr president it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities especially in connection with boosting employment.###it is after all they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.###by allowing them to develop tailormade plans for the relevant regions and if necessary tying this in with financial aid a higher return can be achieved.###surely this must be the ultimate goal.###i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions.###following on from this it is probably also more meaningful with regard to the financial aid to regions to give member states more say anyway.###by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.###finally i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries.###the report shows that in general they are a long way behind eu countries especially in terms of gdp per capita.###with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy.###i would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.###mr president commissioner following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.###for example whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased there has been a certain amount of convergence between the member states themselves in this respect.###equally unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all indeed they rose in some cases.###i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.###even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.###since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout europe to reduce unemployment then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.###genuine structural reforms and a competitionfriendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.###if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a costintensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.###we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.###mr president commissioner my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.###this issue which has an impact on their everyday life is a key issue as regards eu credibility.###it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided i would say quite magnificently the development of poor countries.###i remember what portugal and greece used to be like when i drove through those countries for the first time twentyfive years ago.###in this connection french speakers would speak of a coup de chapeau  in other words i take my hat off to the eu.###the eu really deserves such a gesture but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.###what is the result.###people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.###consequently we have to build schools hospitals and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.###this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.###most people however would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised if they were given the chance to in other words if there was work there.###we must give them this opportunity.###this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have.###the solution as i see it lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.###by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business but creating will.###i mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life whether he or she is an employee the owner of a business or an official.###what is a fair society.###one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.###in this way positive development of the regions is also possible because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.###finally i would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from america where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy as it often is here in europe.###mr president commissioner as my time is limited i shall get straight to the point.###firstly let me make a statement of fact the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the union.###the most remote regions still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates offer one example of this.###in reunion for example the rate is 00.###this is not a situation related to the economic climate however rather it is a structural problem created by our remoteness our insularity in short our own specific personality.###the principle of specific exceptional treatment was envisaged in article 0000 of the treaty of amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.###it only remains to put this principle into practice.###the commission document expected to be ready in december 0000 was delayed until january then february and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.###i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission.###as regards taxation state aid the structural funds and defending our traditional products practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.###if these do not materialise then unfortunately convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions despite the size of the amounts committed will end in failure.###mr president as all the previous speakers have done i should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.###just like the previous report this extremely competent and precise analysis the recommendations it supports and your own comments ladies and gentlemen shall prove useful to the commission in general and to the commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 00000000.###i should also like to make a few comments firstly mr berend regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.###you pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote if i am not mistaken that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.###on behalf of all the officials of the commission and my predecessor mrs wulfmathies i must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this house and by yourself.###the commission was certainly very anxious to ensure mr berend that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.###i am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 0.0 of this report where the commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported improved and influenced by factors which some of you  mr markov just now and mrs raschhofer  stressed very forcefully.###i am thinking of technological research and development infrastructure provision and quality human resources potential small and mediumsized businesses and direct investment from abroad.###so much for the quality.###i do not wish to spend time right now mr berend going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed.###let me just itemise them the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the member states.###secondly partnership a subject which a number of you stressed the role of local and regional authorities the private sector both sides of industry associations and local community action groups.###regarding this problem of partnership i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly.###thirdly the need to develop the employment side of growth even though i am aware as mr van dam just said that the prime responsibility is that of the member states and that when we speak of the responsibility of member states and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.###mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.###mr fruteau we at least need to recognise that there is growth and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession as has been the case in the past.###you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.###i agree with your analysis.###when there is growth it must be better distributed but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness be they the most remote or island regions is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.###fourthly a point which mrs hedkvist petersen stressed just now the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.###fifthly the importance and role of small and mediumsized businesses.###mr vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.###finally the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the structural funds the motives of officials in managing these funds even if it is occasionally complicated and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation followup and supervision of the commission.###in relation to this i must inform the european parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 0000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of structural funds.###i should like to mention a few specific points.###mr berend you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.###well we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.###tomorrow the commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon i hope it will be italy s turn.###you may therefore be satisfied on this point since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 0.###regarding the informal economy you mention in your report i am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and as mr cocilovo mentioned there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.###to a certain extent they are taken into account in the statistics on gdp and labour force surveys and in any case i wish to point out the efforts which eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.###mr berend you also mentioned as did mr aparicio snchez the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.###on this point which is of personal interest to me let me remind you that the small scale of this sector  and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area  and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.###this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries under commissioner fischler.###nonetheless i must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which no doubt will respond better to these concerns.###several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.###i wish to assure you firstly that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is as far as i am concerned mr berend an extremely important instrument not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of europe and furthermore with the elected representatives i.e. yourselves on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a european regional planning policy.###in any event i have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report the definition compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of central and eastern europe a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned particularly mrs sudre and mr fruteau analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of central and eastern europe.###this will constitute a great challenge to us all for you and for the commission in the next few years.###and finally there are the crossborder aspects.###i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.###finally i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are in any case familiar with but whose main elements i should like to reiterate.###ladies and gentlemen considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence particularly for the four cohesion countries but also frankly mr pohjamo for the objective 0 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development especially regarding infrastructure.###this is my first point regarding the policy.###my second point regarding the policy is as follows the structural funds have made and continue to make a significant contribution to the convergence process.###all the macroeconomic models we are working on show that over the last decade more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the structural funds.###i have however taken note particularly with regard to the most remote regions mrs sudre mr fruteau and mr nogueira romn too that your observation is that there is still much to do  and this is my third point regarding the policy  in terms of improving employment takeup aspects the fight against social exclusion which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.###now to my fourth point regarding the policy enlargement of the union the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions the major challenge too for the european policy on cohesion a point which mr van dam highlighted.###i shall say that something is already taking shape in berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.###i am thinking in particular of the preaccession structural instrument which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.###you see ladies and gentlemen we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the union s enlargement on our structural policy.###this sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole mr berend is a good basis for our thinking for us all and for myself.###i should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 00000000.###thank you very much commissioner.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###the sitting was closed at 0.00 p.m.###adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting###the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed.###are there any comments.###mr president i respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the minutes.###i refer to item 00 on the order of business.###firstly i believe the issue raised by the president of the socialist group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the president of the commission on the fiveyear strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.###i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group.###the second point i would like to make  and which i would have wished to make yesterday before the vote  is that this parliament as other speakers remarked yesterday can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the european commission.###we should also have the humility to recognise that if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the president of the commission but also by a fiveyear programme we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this house so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the commission what our wishes were.###there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this.###when there are major setpiece debates scheduled between this house and the european commission in the future we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.###there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission.###we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.###looking at some of the press reports of last friday i believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable selfrestraint in the way they commented publicly.###that is something for which i have a deep appreciation.###i hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which i believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.###it should not be dramatised into something more than that.###thank you very much mr cox.###i understand what you are saying.###we have taken note of this.###mr president concerning item 00 of the minutes on the order of business we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on todays agenda.###however it was withdrawn from the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.###it therefore needs to be withdrawn from todays agenda.###mr wynn that makes sense.###the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.###mr president regarding mrs lynnes comments yesterday about health and safety in this building i presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the tower.###this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.###i do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly but this is a serious problem.###mrs ahern we have taken note of this.###i would ask you to bring this specific case which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor to the attention of the quaestors who are in fact responsible for the matter.###we will also pass this on to our services however.###thank you very much.###the minutes were approved###reform of european competition policy###the next item is the joint debate on the following reports###a000000000 by mr von wogau on behalf of the committee on

000000ecsc of 00 december 0000 establishing community rules for state aid to the steel industry steel aid code.###com0000 00  c000000000  00000000cos.###mr president ladies and gentlemen the commission s white paper on modernisation of the european competition rules has ignited intense and lively debate amongst interested members of the public.###the reactions from experts and persons affected range from complete rejection to unconditional support.###what is this white paper in fact about.###the existing system of european competition rules was set up in the early years of the community.###this system which is based on a centralised application and approvals procedure was certainly appropriate for the conditions prevailing at the time.###this procedure made a substantial contribution to the development of a european competition culture.###however the framework conditions have fundamentally changed in the 00 years since it came into being.###the community of 0 has enlarged to one of 00 and is set to undergo further enlargement to encompass 00 members.###but the system has hardly changed at all.###that is why there is an urgent need for reform and no one takes issue with this in debate.###nevertheless certain critics are of the opinion that the commission s proposals go too far.###the commission wants to abolish the application and approvals procedure and enhance the role of national authorities and courts in the implementation of the competition rules.###in other words this would mean a transition from an authorisation system to one of legal exemption.###however the prohibition principle and this is important is to be retained.###in principle i take the view that we ought when an authority accused of tending towards bureaucracy and centralism submits a proposal for debureaucratisation and decentralisation to at least give this serious consideration.###according to the commissions proposal it all revolves around competitioninhibiting agreements between enterprises and abuses of powerful positions.###however the notification obligation with respect to state aid and corporate concentrations is to be retained.###the committee on economic and monetary affairs gave its blessing in principle to these proposals put forward by the commission with only one vote against and two abstentions.###however it will only be possible to form a conclusive assessment once the currently awaited bills produced by the commission are published.###whilst i may endorse the commission s proposals in principle still there are a number of points that warrant improvement or at least clarification.###i would like to go into some of these points briefly.###many critics of the white paper maintain that decentralisation will jeopardise the consistent application of community legislation.###not all national authorities in particular the courts are in a position as yet to fulfil the role the commission has in mind for them when it comes to the application of the competition rules.###firstly in the course of the last few decades the national monopolies have familiarised themselves with the implementation of the competition rules to an adequate degree.###secondly the national courts will be empowered to implement articles 00 0 00 and 00 in accordance with the current administration of justice.###nonetheless it is still extremely important for the commission to support the national authorities and courts with group exemption regulations guidelines and notices.###furthermore cooperation between the national authorities and the commission as well as amongst the national authorities themselves must be strengthened.###as far as the competence of the national courts is concerned we recommend in this report that specialised courts be set up for dealing with monopolies law proceedings.###these are already in existence in certain member states and they have proved successful.###entrepreneurs for their part fear a loss of legal certainty.###in order to guard against this the enterprises should in certain cases continue to have the opportunity of being given prior clarification by the commission.###these are only a few albeit central aspects that must be taken into account where the modernisation of the european competition rules is concerned.###that said the process is still very much in its infancy.###discussion will continue until such time as legislative proposals are eventually produced.###however i am convinced of the fact that the white paper has put us on the right path.###a european competition culture has come into being in the course of the last few decades.###the decentralisation proposed by the commission accords with the principle of subsidiarity which has in fact now been firmly established in the treaty.###this leads to increased implementation of the european competition rules at national and regional level thereby making it possible for the european competition culture to be placed on a broader basis.###finally i would like to say that the competition policy reform we are introducing here is a necessity and that it is going to be absolutely necessary in this context to clarify that the european union s competition policy is an essential prerequisite to the success of a social market economy.###both the commission and parliament must do more than they have done hitherto to get the message across that competition policy competition between enterprises and the fact that the european commission is supervising this are first and foremost matters which have the interests of the citizens at heart.###mr president commissioner today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union s competition policy.###we are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for european monopolies law that is mr von wogau s report and it is far more controversial than the vote in the committee on economic and monetary affairs may have given us reason to believe.###i want to make it quite clear that in this specific case i personally consider the commission s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term modernisation to describe the content of articles 00 and 00 of the white paper or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression retrograde step .###however we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 0000 and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.###but of course both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper.###it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy.###on reading both commission documents one learns that 0000 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 0000 were pursued and even partially completed which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.###allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture.###as the competent authority the commission with its logically consistent approach has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition not always to the delight of the member states or enterprises concerned.###it should continue along this path.###but commissioner none of this is to become less complicated in future  one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the union the deepening of the internal market technological progress globalisation.###indeed it is not just about modernisation of community law more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions for the european competition policy will be dependent on the population s acceptance together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.###only without transparency there will be no acceptance indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.###the competition report 0000 is not a bad foundation for this but in fact there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.###resumption of the session###i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 00 december 0000 and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.###although as you will have seen the dreaded millennium bug failed to materialise still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.###you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this partsession.###in the meantime i should like to observe a minute s silence as a number of members have requested on behalf of all the victims concerned particularly those of the terrible storms in the various countries of the european union.###please rise then for this minute s silence.###the house rose and observed a minute s silence###madam president on a point of order.###you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka.###one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago.###would it be appropriate for you madam president to write a letter to the sri lankan president expressing parliaments regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation.###yes mr evans i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.###if the house agrees i shall do as mr evans has suggested.###madam president on a point of order.###i would like your advice about rule 000 concerning inadmissibility.###my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again.###the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 0 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.###it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.###i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.###i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report not a legislative proposal and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday.###that is precisely the time when you may if you wish raise this question i.e. on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.###madam president coinciding with this year s first partsession of the european parliament a date has been set unfortunately for next thursday in texas in america for the execution of a young 00 yearold man who has been sentenced to death.###we shall call him mr hicks.###at the request of a french member mr zimeray a petition has already been presented which many people signed including myself.###however i would ask you in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community to make representations using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent to the president and to the governor of texas mr bush who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.###this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.###thank you mr segni i shall do so gladly.###indeed it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted.###madam president i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest.###it is the case of alexander nikitin.###all of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in russia too access to environmental information is a constitutional right.###now however he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.###we know and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed including specifically during the last plenary partsession of last year that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for alexander nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.###these findings form the basis of the european programmes to protect the barents sea and that is why i would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make parliaments position as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted clear as far as russia is concerned.###yes mrs schroedter i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter.###madam president i would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that during this first partsession of the new year the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.###but madam president my personal request has not been met.###although there are now two finnish channels and one portuguese one there is still no dutch channel which is what i had requested because dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.###i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well.###mrs plooijvan gorsel i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors meeting on wednesday.###it will i hope be examined in a positive light.###madam president can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes.###why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected.###why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 0000.###why has there been no fire drill either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings.###why are there no fire instructions.###why have the staircases not been improved since my accident.###why are nosmoking areas not enforced.###it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.###mrs lynne you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done.###i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestors and i am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.###madam president mrs dez gonzlez and i had tabled questions on certain opinions of the vicepresident mrs de palacio which appeared in a spanish newspaper.###the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous partsession.###i would ask that they reconsider since this is not the case.###the questions answered previously referred to mrs de palacio s intervention on another occasion and not to these comments which appeared in the abc newspaper on 00 november.###mr berenguer fuster we shall check all this.###i admit that at present the matter seems to be somewhat confused.###we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.###madam president i should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from parliament this week about our discontent over todays decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia considering that the vast majority in this parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past.###todays decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.###so parliament should send a message since that is the wish of the vast majority.###it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo.###as people have said the situation there is extremely volatile.###there is in fact a risk of a military coup in the future.###we do not know what is happening.###so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people.###in any event this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday.###agenda###the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 00 january pursuant to rule 000 of the rules of procedure.###no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday.###relating to wednesday###the group of the party of european socialists requests that a commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the commission.###i would like mr barn crespo who made the request to speak to propose it.###that is if he so wishes of course.###then we shall follow the usual procedure hearing one speaker in favour and one against.###madam president the presentation of the prodi commission s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the group of the party of european socialists which was unanimously approved by the conference of presidents in september and which was also explicitly accepted by president prodi who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.###this commitment is important because the commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaties and therefore basically dictates this parliament s political and legislative activity for the next five years.###i would also like to point out madam president that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature.###it did so again during this legislature in july and then in september it voted once more to approve the whole commission.###there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.###to this end i would like to remind you of the resolution of 00 september which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.###the events of last week  which originated outside the conference of presidents that conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere  present us with a dilemma.###either the commission is not ready to present this programme in which case it should clarify it.###according to its president it is in a position to do so.###given that the commission is represented by vicepresident de palacio i believe that before voting it would help if the commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme as agreed.###alternatively parliament is not ready to examine this programme as some appear to be suggesting.###in my opinion this second hypothesis would imply the failure of parliament in its duty as a parliament as well as introducing an original thesis an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware in writing of a speech concerning the commission s programme a week earlier  and not a day earlier as had been agreed  bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in february so we could forego the debate since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the internet and parliament will no longer have to worry about it.###my group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen debate and reflect there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that if the commission is ready to do so we still have time to reestablish the original agreement between parliament and the commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.###therefore the proposal of the group of the party of european socialists and which you have mentioned is that the prodi commission present its legislative programme on wednesday including its proposed administrative reform because otherwise we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation on the pretext that there is no text on the one hand the president of the commission would be denied his right to speak in this parliament and on the other hand there would be a debate on a reform when parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.###therefore madam president i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.###applause from the pse group###madam president i really am quite astonished at mr barn crespo s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on wednesdays agenda.###mr barn crespo you were unable to attend the conference of presidents last thursday.###i am not criticising this it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them.###mr hnsch represented you on this occasion.###in the conference of presidents we had an indepth discussion.###your group was alone in advocating what you are saying now.###we then put it to a vote.###as you know each chairman has the same number of votes as his group has members.###there was a vote on this matter.###as i recall the outcome of this vote was 000 votes to 000 with a few abstentions.###this means that all the groups with the exception of the nonattached members  but of course they are not a group  were in agreement only your group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here.###all of the others were of a different opinion.###that was the decision.###i should now like to comment on the issue itself.###we have confidence in the commission and in romano prodi and after a difficult procedure as everyone knows the vast majority of our group supported the vote of confidence in romano prodi and the commission.###we believe however that the commissions strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the european parliament but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the commission and which describes this programme over the fiveyear period.###there is no such document.###the commission will present its programme for the year 0000 in february.###we have said very well if the commission does not wish to introduce the 0000 programme as early as january then we will do it in february.###we have agreed to this.###after all we do not wish to quarrel with the commission if at all possible we believe that the commission and parliament need to tread the same path.###however we in parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the commission.###i should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the fiveyear programme in our groups.###you cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this house and have no idea of its content.###that is why we would recommend  and it is my impression that the commission is also open to this idea  that we hold the debate on the commissions longterm programme up to the year 0000 in february  and i hope that the commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us  and that at the same time in february we also hold the debate on the commissions legislative programme for the year 0000.###the fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together.###that is why my group firmly rejects the proposal made by the socialist group.###applause from the ppede group###madam president i would like to make it very clear that above all the commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this parliament and amongst those the decision establishing its agenda.###we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide.###but i would also like to make it very clear that president prodi made a commitment to this parliament to introduce a new debate as mr barn crespo has reminded us which would be in addition to the annual debate on the commission s legislative programme on the broad areas of action for the next five years that is to say for this legislature.###madam president i would like to say that the agreement reached in september distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the commission s legislative programme.###i would also like to say that the commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.###therefore madam president i would like to repeat that the commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and when parliament decides  this week if that is the decision  we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and next month the programme for 0000 which is what we fully agreed upon.###i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.###parliament rejected the request president.###still on the subject of wednesday s sitting i have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.###the ppede group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.###is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this.###madam president i can hear a ripple of laughter from the socialists.###i was told that large sections of the socialist group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda because at the vote in the conference of presidents no vote was received from the working group of members of the socialist group responsible for this matter.###i do not know whether this information is correct but the ppede group would in any case be grateful if this item were removed because parliament has addressed this issue several times already.###decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.###that is why my group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.###thank you mr poettering.###we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request.###madam president i would firstly like to point out mr poettering s lack of logic.###he has just been preaching to the group of the party of european socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the conference of presidents and now he is doing just the same.###we discussed that matter and we were unanimous with the exception of the ppe and eldr groups.###as my fellow chairmen will recall i even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the tobin tax but of whether one dared to hear what the commission and the council thought of it.###it is not a lot to ask.###i therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the commission and the council should be retained so that we can find out once and for all the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the seattle conference.###we shall proceed to vote on the ppede group s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.###parliament rejected the request with 000 votes for 000 votes against and 0 abstentions###madam president i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate.###thank you very much.###madam president has my vote been counted.###i was unable to vote electronically since i do not have a card.###my vote was in favour .###indeed if we add the two members who have declared themselves then the result of the vote would be ....###madam president the presidency has already declared the result of the vote.###there is no room for amendments.###ladies and gentlemen once again we see it is essential for members to bring their voting cards along on a monday.###clearly there is a problem here.###that being the case i shall have to make a decision.###i too forgot my card and i would have voted against.###i therefore consider that the oral question may be kept on the agenda as per the vote.###this is the last time that we shall make allowances for members who have forgotten their cards.###let that be clearly noted and understood.###applausethe oral question will therefore remain on the agenda and yes your president is entitled to vote just as she is entitled to forget her voting card.###we shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda.###madam president in the earlier vote  and i will abide by your ruling on this matter  on the question of the strategic plan of the commission i indicated that i would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my group.###that did not happen.###i would appreciate it if on the close of this item of business i might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group.###this is an important matter.###it would be useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.###madam president i do not wish to reopen the debate but i had also asked for the floor to comment on mr barn crespos motion.###you did not call me either.###i regret this but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.###i am terribly sorry mr hnsch and mr cox.###i did not see you asking to speak.###even so i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes.###when we adopt the minutes for today s sitting tomorrow then any members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.###this seems to me to be a workable solution.###of course the minutes for tomorrow s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.###i think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely timeconsuming explanations of votes.###mr cox mr hnsch would this be acceptable to you.###madam president if the vote records correctly how my group voted i shall not and cannot object to that.###if your ruling is that i cannot give an explanation of vote i accept that but with reservations.###we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes as we always do of course.###if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted then we may correct them if necessary.###the order of business was adopted thus amended###safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods###the next item is the report a000000000 by mr koch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterways c000000000  00000000cod.###commissioner madam president ladies and gentlemen i can be quite frank in saying that i welcome the councils common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway.###firstly we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of directive 0000ec which obliges the member states to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.###secondly by adopting this directive we achieve a an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped b a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c equal opportunities for safety advisers on the european labour market.###thirdly this directive as it currently stands in the common position guarantees  in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards  a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the european union by adopting it we contribute to the member states bearing a high level of individual responsibility.###all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.###our amendments from the first reading have i believe been taken into account very satisfactorily.###they have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance or they have been rejected because the corresponding european arrangements have not been included for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.###the one unanimously adopted amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive is something which i would urge you to support.###by not setting a specific date for the member states to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.###i would urge you to endorse this.###madam president we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads but also on our railways and waterways not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because  as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles  a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.###as an austrian i still have a vivid memory as i believe we all do of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the tauern tunnel where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.###the renovation project which lasted for months cut off this important route between the north and south of europe.###the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit.###in fact all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.###prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards welltrained safety advisers being available so that the right action is taken in good time.###all the same we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety.###we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the member states in good time and  even more importantly  we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.###please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.###i should like to address one final point.###we must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that where transport safety in europe is concerned there is still much more to be done.###in this context i should like to make a request and ask the commissioner responsible who is with us here today to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future so that we in europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.###madam president first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which has at its heart the issue of transport safety.###the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road rail and inland waterway.###i congratulate him on his excellent report.###transport safety has sadly been in the news recently the paddington rail crash in london the terrible rail crash in norway the two aviation crashes involving eu citizens and the natural disaster involving the erika off brittany  all within the last four months  remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.###the rapporteur has pointed out to the house that in its common position the council has accepted six of parliaments ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of parliaments other amendments has been retained.###my group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the european union as safe as possible.###when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.###we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.###madam president i would like to make a few comments.###i would like first of all to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and secondly the commission for the proposal it has submitted.###we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also in fact with minimum requirements.###this is a pity in a sense.###needless to say safety on roads railways and inland waterways is of key importance and given the international nature of these types of transport training for safety advisors should also be harmonised therefore as well as the requirements of the new adr for example which is under way.###this is important but so is enforcement and there are of course a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.###just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years for example in belgium the netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.###or ships from eastern europe which moor adjacent to ships over here with all the obvious risks that this entails.###furthermore it has transpired that research in the ports in belgium finland but also in japan has shown that 00 of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.###in short the issue is an important one.###if we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 0 january of this year.###there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present especially with smaller companies as these cannot afford safety advisors.###these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo which causes problems.###it is therefore also being requested that iso 0000 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.###the work is done.###all that remains is the business of enforcement.###i would like to mention one final point.###with regard to enforcement proper agreements must also be concluded with the eastern european countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 0 july 0000 that is to say in eighteen months time.###this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.###this is not in itself anything dreadful but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road rail and inland waterways and incorporate these as part of the acquis communautaire as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.###madam president the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so.###the ever increasing volume of goods passing through europe entails all kinds of risks known and unknown for employees and the social environment.###those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.###the relevant standards which have been laid down in another directive 0000ec seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.###i am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the council on minimum standards regarding examinations although i would have preferred it if uniform set standards and modules had been established so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.###this however does not seem feasible.###finally the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can therefore give it my wholehearted support.###mr president commissioner i should first like to congratulate mr koch on his reports which though technical are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.###i should like to make just a few comments.###firstly i should like to ask the commissioner  and i am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground  to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety be it on the roads on the waterways or at sea.###considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a commission proposal first made on 00 march 0000 even though parliament responded relatively quickly this time lag is a little too long.###this is not just the fault of the commission but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.###my second point has already been mentioned it concerns the minimum standards.###in principle i believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and countryspecific rules.###however when it comes to safety i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden for example is in principle no different from safety in germany italy or austria.###i can live with these minimum standards but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully.###should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.###my third point has also been mentioned already.###as you know like mr rack i come from a transit country where this issue plays a particularly important role.###we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as austria or other transit countries.###but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum in all countries whether they are transit countries or not.###mr president i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur mr koch on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway.###we understand that it is important that the two institutions  parliament and commission  cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the committee on regional policy and in particular the transport group is magnificent.###the common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and at second reading we can accept the amendment on the proposed date which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the commission bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.###very briefly i would like to thank the various members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the commission s priorities in the field of transport.###as mr simpson has said very correctly this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.###the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.###in this regard i would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels which messrs rack and swoboda have referred to which in the case of austria is doubtless a very sensitive issue and great effort should be made to improve their safety.###in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.###margarine and a few kilos of paint which in principle do not present risks led to a genuine disaster.###therefore we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.###finally i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.###this week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport in light of the erika disaster and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.###but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission.###as i will say in the debate on the erika disaster we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.###i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur mr koch.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###transport of dangerous goods by road###the next item is the report a000000000 by mr koch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 0000ec on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road com0000 000  c000000000  00000000cod.###mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road which entered into force on 0 january 0000 contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the cen that is the european committee for standardisation.###delays in the cen s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.###in particular annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.###i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.###in this respect i accept this proposal to amend directive 0000ec which has been tabled for discussion today.###should the european union fail to take action then member states would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period until the cen completes its work which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.###the amendment to the directive on todays agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community.###it merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines deletes provisions which are no longer applicable and lays down the procedures for a carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b enacting less stringent national regulations in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.###the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity the member states obtain more powers.###the commission decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own.###in so doing it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.###the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down afresh in the council decision of june 0000.###the proposal to be discussed today to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road dates from may 0000 however and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.###two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.###we would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the council has to make a decision  which is not clearly worded  is set at a maximum of three months.###in addition the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.###a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements in particular for vacuum tanks if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below 00c.###this is in the special interest of northern european regions.###a final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 0 january 0000 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.###i do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety but i would ask you to endorse this report.###mr president colleagues a happy new year and millennium to you all.###i am speaking for the first time in this plenary partsession so this is quite exciting for me a little like first love although that did last longer than two minutes.###i would like to briefly comment on the commission s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.###it is good that this directive should be established now as otherwise member states would have to amend their national acts for a very short time a period of transition which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to eu bureaucracy.###the commission s proposal however does not take account of all the facts such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.###consequently i have tabled some amendments to mr koch s intrinsically excellent report which have been adopted by our committee.###my amendments concern the frostresistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.###according to the commission s proposal 00c would have been sufficient.###on the shores of the mediterranean it is hard to imagine that in lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.###there is support for the eu in lapland also so let us remember them.###i have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to 00c.###this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.###i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow s vote.###mr president with your permission i should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.###i thought that it was quite superb.###on the subject at hand i think that the people of europe must be able to be confident that the goods  however dangerous they are  which are transported on europes roads railways and so on are as safe as possible.###this directive is a contribution to this.###what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.###the rapporteur mr koch to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the cen which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.###that is why we can only hope  and we should resolve all of this this week  that in 0000 we will finally have community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.###commissioner mr president i would first like to thank mr koch for his excellent report which i do not have a great deal to add to.###i would like to take the opportunity just to point out that the transport of dangerous goods continues to cause major problems not just in india where i have just come from but also within the eu.###we only have to think of the serious accident in the mont blanc tunnel about a year ago not to mention the one in the tauern tunnel.###we observe that there is always a possibility of major problems of this kind occurring where nature gives rise to troublesome phenomena such as mist storms or cold weather particularly in the narrow alpine passes.###in general i would urge that the transport of dangerous goods is transferred more to rail.###in this context when planning future railway tracks or motorways a preventative approach should be taken and the appropriate longterm solution built into the process early on.###i would remind you of the brenner base tunnel which has not been touched on even indirectly.###while i am on the subject i would also like to point out that transport problems are one of the key issues facing the eu and call on the commission to give due attention to this.###we need to have much more probing and vigorous debate on cuttingdown on transport heavy rail traffic road pricing and railway privatisation with a view to improving functionality.###considering that enlargement towards the east will create a few more problems then it becomes clear to us all that the future credibility of the eu will depend on whether and in what manner we succeed in sorting out the transport situation.###mr president the report we are discussing here does not in itself entail any major changes.###most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.###it is nonetheless worth emphasising that each time we make this type of decision it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.###very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu both on roads and railways and by sea.###this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.###in area after area we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states.###this is extraordinarily positive and there is cause to thank the rapporteur mr koch for the work he has put in on this issue.###this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.###if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also as far as possible apply to every country.###i should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance namely an amendment tabled by member of parliament mr ari vatanen.###in many ways the prerequisites differ from one member state to another.###by approving this amendment we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union.###this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.###it is good that in establishing the present regulations we can also be flexible.###i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment.###mr president i would like to thank not only mr koch but also the vicepresident of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.###the reason mr koch produced his sound report was because the work in the cen and within the united nations economic commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.###i would like to ask the vicepresident if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations and whether the eu is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.###for one thing is clear even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the european union traffic does not stop at our borders it goes beyond them.###hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more farreaching regional provisions.###if the commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the cen and the economic commission are at.###mr president i would once again like to congratulate mr koch on his magnificent work on this other report which in a way supplements the debate which we held in october on rail transport.###we all regret that the european committee for standardisation cen has not been able in the required time to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the european union.###this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this europe of ours.###a moment ago mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures not of 00 degrees below zero but of 00 degrees below zero.###of course we accept that amendment  it is absolutely right  and i believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the european union which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.###i would like to say with regard to mr swoboda s comments on the activity of the cen that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if despite the new deadline we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.###lastly mr president the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out.###we have referred to the delay by the cen the amendment of certain provisions the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.###the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur mr koch which are contained in the various amendments specifically four.###we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###structural funds  cohesion fund coordination###the next item is the report a000000000 by mrs schroedter on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the communication from the commission in the field of the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund guidelines for programmes in the period 00000000 com0000000  c000000000  00000000cos.###mr president commissioner ah now i see commissioner fischler is here and there i was thinking that you would not be coming.###welcome to parliament.###ladies and gentlemen we cannot overlook the fact that the benefits of the european internal market are reaped most of all by the wealthy regions and even there they are not enjoyed by all sections of the population.###how long do we actually intend to allow this kind of development to go on for resulting as it does in the widening gulf between poor and wealthy regions.###whilst in the fifth report on the situation in the regions unemployment was seven times higher in the poor regions than in the wealthy regions the sixth report is already talking in terms of it being eight times higher despite the fact that european structural funds are pouring into the regions.###hence it will of course come as no surprise to anyone that the very preamble to the new structural funds regulation places great emphasis on the call for the funds to be implemented more efficiently and in a more concentrated manner in order to achieve the european objectives of high employment levels and sustainable development to name but a few.###parliament but above all the member states demanded massive improvements.###this was very soon forgotten however when the commission developed the new instrument for the purpose the guidelines and wanted to make the requirement for there to be efficiency concentration and simplification of administration in the implementation of the european structural funds more binding.###subsequently the member state governments referred to the principle of subsidiarity and just wanted to get their hands on the money.###and so all that remained of the 0000 berlin summit was the indicative nature of the guidelines.###however this at least places the commission under the obligation to approve only those programmes that will actually enable european objectives to be achieved.###i may have my doubts as to whether this indicative instrument will actually succeed in achieving efficiency and increased concentration and in actually putting the european objectives into practice but it is a fact that the guidelines will be of central importance to the negotiations for the community development programme.###if you want our work at european level to be taken seriously then you must also take it seriously yourselves.###parliament was not in a position to go into the content of the guidelines because it was not consulted until the legislative period was long since past.###now that the programming phases are so far on there is little point in starting from scratch again.###that is why in my report i concentrate on the strategic nature of the instrument with the blessing of the committee.###firstly the report assesses the impact of the instrument per se.###secondly it uncovers the shortcomings in the commission document.###for example the question of partnership was simply left out of the central part of the structural funds.###one searches the document in vain for the central principle which calls upon the member states to see that programmes are implemented at local level in conjunction not only with the local authorities and regions but also with local actors business and social organisations ngos unions employers associations women s organisations citizens initiatives and employment initiatives.###the question as to why it was left out has not been answered to date.###parliament makes demands here that are of central importance.###it expects the commission to only approve those programmes established on the basis of partnerships of this kind.###it surprised me members of the conservative group to suddenly find that amendments aimed at dropping the decentralising approach had been produced overnight.###all i can say is try taking this to your regions and explaining to your electorate why the european principle of decentralisation is not to be put into practice in the regions.###let me tell you you will not escape from that one unscathed.###we cannot have a situation where we agree principles in this house and when it comes to implementing them everyone does their own thing again.###incidentally i would just like to address a comment to the government of my country where there is a desire simply to ignore the horizontal community policy concerning environmental protection and where it was maintained that there was no need to implement the ffh guideline.###i believe it is a good thing that the commission is holding firm here.###this brings me to my final point.###the guidelines must serve as the hard and fast criteria we use to assess whether article 0 of the regulation is actually being implemented.###i expect the commission to ensure that the guidelines which certainly allow for adequate flexibility are in every sense the benchmark for the negotiations.###we represent the european position.###in other words sustainability in transport policy must be taken into account every bit as much as the entitlement of women to a share of financial support as must the fact that each programme should make provision for the overall contribution thus enabling there to be sustainable urban development and truly model projects in rural areas.###this is what i expect the outcome of the community development programmes to be and i do not expect you to give way on this again.###how else otherwise do we propose to reduce the unemployment rate.###not by continuing to wait and trying to cheat our way through again.###we cannot wait.###in a few years time we will no longer be able to spend so much money on implementing european structural policy because a great many more countries will be joining us and then we will have no choice but to create much improved more efficient and more concentrated structures.###and that will only be the beginning.###i therefore expect the commission to take parliament s demands seriously in the course of the negotiations and to actually put the european position into practice here giving a progressive regional policy a chance at long last.###mr president it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the european parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the united kingdom that i represent in this parliament namely wales.###a major part of wales as you know has been granted objective 0 status under the structural funds programme.###it is quite clear that many people within wales are looking to the european structural funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.###we have seen poverty growing in wales and growing still further since 0000.###we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.###we are looking therefore within the structural funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the principality.###what is however deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of structural funds assistance is something that has been in a sense a success of the government.###it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces.###that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront.###we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.###we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures.###we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.###we look to it to challenge the uk government to ensure that the private sector which surely must be providing the major impetus for structural funds expenditure is involved in the planning stage.###finally we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.###too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent.###this is one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wales.###mr president our committee views these issues very differently and to start i will speak from the point of view of research.###we see it as a very positive sign that in her own conclusions the rapporteur has taken account of our committee s proposal that the cohesion fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.###this will be possible with action on the part of governments and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.###another matter we would like to address specifically from the point of view of industrial policy is that we would have liked the commission to pay more attention to the effects of services electronic commerce and the growing use of the internet when they were planning the coordination of structural funds and cohesion funds.###poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.###the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry but today those areas might have become a burden and they may well be poor meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production as i might call it and the production of services because they are the industries of the future.###in my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this so on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research and energy i would draw the commission s attention to this issue.###finally as the committee representing energy we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from cohesion and regional development funds to have been emphasised still more thus through a process of coordination increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.###mr president i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that i am speaking for my colleague mrs flautre who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill.###i would like to draw peoples attention to amendments nos 0 and 0 which were agreed by the committee on employment and social affairs but not accepted by the committee on regional policy transport and tourism.###these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.###in the past this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.###these amendments also fit in with this parliaments view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.###we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.###in her report mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking yet desperately needed.###the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund.###but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 00000000 programme.###it could be said that the omission gives the impression that the commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between european social fund assistance which is subject to review after three and a half years and the member states annual national plans for employment.###we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.###mr president commissioner the proposal presented by the commission in accordance with its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development.###i would like to point out however that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us maintaining a population in rural areas given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.###this as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.###the consequences do not inspire hope.###it is the young people who are disappearing who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.###this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.###we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union.###agriculture only provides 0.0 of employment in the union.###furthermore three quarters of our farm workers are parttime and require supplements to their incomes.###for this reason one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the european union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside of the agricultural sector in sectors such as rural tourism sport culture heritage conservation the conversion of businesses new technologies services etc.###however even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive it is still essential not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.###therefore we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set.###we want rural areas at the dawn of the 00st century to be competitive and multifunctional both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of nonagricultural activities.###it is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium and to bear in mind the conclusions of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the five fundamental issues which have been only partly taken up by the committee on transport regional policy and tourism in its points 00 and 00.###in conclusion i would ask the commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because i believe that for the european union maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.###mr president commissioner i would like to begin by thanking mrs schroedter the rapporteur for her work.###i think that this work has been carried out extremely well.###i would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments  and perhaps there are more of them than we expected  but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.###we feel that it is important that the commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this parliament at least in spirit because at this stage it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise and nothing but hot air.###the truth of the matter though is that we believe  and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted  that the commission must take account of what is adopted by this parliament particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.###in our amendments we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the structural funds the cohesion fund and community initiatives so that their application should be reflected in the best and most profitable way by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are when all is said and done the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.###in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives we think that those who generate employment the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment that is businesspeople must participate in this initiative.###small and mediumsized businesses above all need to take part in the distribution of these funds.###if they do not if businesspeople feel marginalised if entrepreneurs cannot take part not only in managing but also in receiving these funds we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.###also in order to attain our objectives to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.###all of this must be done  i repeat  with the participation of private business which by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations but complementing them never obstructing or excluding them will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.###mr president it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague mr evans of why wales actually achieved objective 0 status.###it was because of the discredited policies of his own conservative party.###let me also remind him that when his party leader mr hague was secretary of state for wales he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from commissioner wulfmathies regarding regulatory requirements.###i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective 0 additionality.###i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation.###my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.###i want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.###the objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional lifesupport machine.###it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hitech sector.###it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that europe is rapidly losing ground to the us in the hitech growth industries of the future.###the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.###they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.###they should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development resulting in inevitable delays and underspends particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.###the implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer either in the commission or in the civil service.###there must be an internal coherence in the commission directorate while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes.###the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fundusers and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.###if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence which will be the key to future success.###this is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines whether eu regional policy with a good solid enabling guideline can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the eu.###mr president commissioner i would like to thank mrs schroedter for an excellent report.###she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.###the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.###we are badly behind now in this matter.###hopefully the stands parliament has taken will help however in the midterm appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.###for the time the report grew too large when it was being debated.###it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.###at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer union regional policy bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.###our group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity the responsibility of member states and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.###it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.###our group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.###we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the union and its member states exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.###projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.###funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.###projects have to be carried out more efficiently more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.###while the report was being prepared it was interesting to discuss the union s regional policy in general.###for us new members it was the first time and this was a very interesting process.###this report is very good and our group supports it.###mr president commissioner as proof that this parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution the excellent report by a fellow member of my group elisabeth schroedter has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 00000000 for objective 0 regions have been sitting in the commission s offices for several months.###bearing this in mind this house should in any event demand that before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved they be studied and submitted for debate in this parliament specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.###this is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and leastdeveloped regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards a fairer europe.###mr president we should not forget that the main strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.###we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.###we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a europe of citizens and not just in a europe of states and of regions.###we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.###we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.###some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.###we will have to study several indicators which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others and how they are evolving.###it is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to parliament s plenary sitting today that europe s 00 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 00 least prosperous regions.###this fact means that the european parliament the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically.###i agree that the european parliament did not have the opportunity  or that it was not given the opportunity as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term  to discuss the directives.###i do not think however that this report has come too late.###we need to consider it together so that the new objective 0 programmes and the plans for regional development which have been drafted before the directives come into force can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.###we all agree that we should ask that halfway through these programmes when the assessment of the directives is made parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens representatives.###our citizens cannot accept that the european union takes decisions in a way that is at least on the face of it bureaucratic.###they need to see the political dimension working to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.###this is what we are today asking the commissioner for.###i would like to think that given his previous experience as a regional president he will agree to propose indicators and a strategy which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.###mr president i support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the period 00000000 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of eu structural and cohesion funds.###this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.###member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.###this latter point is of particular importance.###while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.###we do not want to build a europe of cities alone.###the structural funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries mainly through the upgrading of roads water treatment and related transport networks.###this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary partsession.###key eu programmes between 0000 0000 0000 and 0000 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 0 regions within europe.###the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date.###this would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions the poorer regions in europe are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone as well as within an everexpanding internal market where the free movement of goods persons services and capital exist.###in conclusion while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the european regional development fund and the cohesion fund we should remember that the european social fund has played a very important role in helping the less welloff in our society.###the social fund has certainly improved our thirdlevel institutions financed our postleaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and longterm unemployment assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.###mr president on numerous occasions in the past i have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues.###this time however i actually agree with her.###whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path i cannot say.###nevertheless i would like to commend her on her work.###the second point i would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex as we and mrs mccarthy as rapporteurs for the general regulation had asked.###unfortunately this did not happen.###mr berni is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.###i am raising the issue just to reiterate parliament s position.###thirdly we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.###they are particularly beneficial to the member states and i would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development job creation and more particularly on equal opportunities and transport issues.###personally i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.###as an islander however i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.###this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves.###this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament and i have raised the issue time and time again.###commissioner we shall continue to raise the issue as article 000 paragraph 0 of the treaty of amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.###therefore the commission should address the issue once and for all.###the time has come to implement the programmes and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.###as for us in parliament i would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which was signed in may.###i am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.###mr president commissioner in this minute and a half i should like first of all to congratulate mrs schroedter.###i know many have already done so but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides and i think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.###i share the regrets she expressed namely that parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that i cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect which in my view is a pity.###consequently i feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the midterm review in 0000 and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 0000.###in brief i would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 00000000 which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.###the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.###subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.###we must ask ourselves a fundamental question how can we ensure that union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development.###the second challenge is that of enlargement which will of course have a considerable impact both in budgetary and geographical terms.###these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us.###finally in this time of natural disasters i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds.###as you know it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation.###europe should not be completely absent as the states tend to want.###public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.###i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.###i also think we should ensure or ask member states to ensure that there is some publicity given to european aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.###mr president the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.###as far as french planning experts are concerned for example the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.###well the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.###our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.###its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds.###what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at european level.###the commission however though bound to issue guidelines does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.###the report put forward today reestablishes its place in the political sphere.###it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.###this is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.###mr president i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.###over the coming years faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement europe will more than ever before require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.###to this end europe as a whole and each member state individually will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities including the structural funds.###for this to be possible what we need from the european commission are not just good intentions but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the member states.###for example in recent years italy has had problems in utilising the structural funds mainly because of excessive bureaucracy insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.###there are therefore two points to which i would like to draw the commission s attention.###firstly we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decisionmaking precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.###secondly a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent since they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated to the point of hindering access to the funds.###this is something about which european small and mediumsized businesses in particular tend to complain.###i will conclude mr president by saying that the failure of the commission s communication to focus on territorial pacts and especially methods of combating unemployment among women and young people is cause for serious concern.###mr president like my colleague mr evans it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue especially since i represent a part of the united kingdom the west midlands which has hitherto benefited from objective 0 funding in particular.###but the report before the house tonight is a prime example of how if we are not very careful we can produce very grandiosesounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.###the report itself is wellintentioned but as so often when we deal with these issues lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.###that is why i and my group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text not to take anything away from the proposal but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.###i would like to explain our thinking here.###firstly we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds.###past experience dictates that as the elected representatives of the european taxpayer we should and indeed must demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as value for money indicators in the grantgiving process.###next we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.###but at the midway point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.###our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer but we also avoid the wellrehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.###finally we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.###there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.###also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from smallscale revenuebased projects which are hard to monitor towards capital schemes where in the majority of cases the benefits are there for all to see.###that way the muchtrumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the european parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.###if these changes to the report are supported by the house today i believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about namely to assist  in a financially sustainable manner  those deprived areas of the european union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living not by giving a handout but by giving a handup.###i urge the house to support these changes.###mr president commissioner i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.###the european union s structural and cohesion policies are without doubt essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.###despite the steps taken thus far these levels are still very high and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.###these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thoughtout and sensible guidelines.###let us not forget that when these policies are effective they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life.###let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the european union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development unless of course the commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the european mainland.###in closing i would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium for which we all hope for the best.###mr president mrs schroedter s report undoubtedly contains several important observations and i would like to congratulate her on that.###however i feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community s regional policy.###quite briefly structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way rather it aggravates it.###the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers particularly in the south.###regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states.###if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.###little consideration if any at all has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure transport communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.###the union s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.###a large section of the union s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grassroots.###unfortunately the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.###mr president i would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the union.###the first is the fundamental central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.###we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously.###we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union s fundamental objectives.###secondly i agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and i would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.###in future we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as in my country the islands of the azores and madeira.###i would like to ask if the commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the commission s report on the outermost regions which has been long awaited by parliament.###mr president first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.###mr president commissioner the guidelines are intended to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.###however contrary to their claim to provide guidance the commission s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.###nonetheless their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.###i agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the member states on simplifying administration and i support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labourintensive small and mediumsized enterprises on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing and on startup help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.###i am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my group to paragraph 00 to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.###i should be very grateful mrs schroedter if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.###mr president commissioner in the committee on employment and social affairs we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the structural and cohesion funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.###unfortunately the excellent schroedter report did not take account of this criterion despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show  as we shall see later in the berend report  how in fact these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from europe s most highlydeveloped regions.###they are growing but only in terms of gdp.###they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.###commissioner please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs and treat it as a matter of priority because this is our citizens greatest problem.###please take account in strategic terms in the revision and in the allocation of reserves of employment needs because this fundamentally is what the structural funds and the cohesion funds require.###mr president it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial sevenyear period 00000000 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation particularly for women and young people and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.###it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas employment in rural areas aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the european union and for the greek islands which of course comprise half of the islands of the union as stipulated in article 000 of the treaty.###cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.###mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to mrs schroedter s report.###everyone understands mrs schroedter ladies and gentlemen the reasons and the time limits involved  and i shall come back to this point presently  and whatever the time limits or delays since we are discussing this report right now as the representative for the commission i consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 00000000 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.###mrs schroedter you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the member states and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters european union cofinancing of the programmes requires and is the justification for a situation where community priorities as debated and approved in this house should also be taken into account in order to promote this community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.###so ladies and gentlemen i should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you mrs schroedter and the various members of this house have made.###regarding the role and structure of these guidelines mr hatzidakis mrs schroedter and mrs mccarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of structural fund objectives 0 0 and 0 as well as their links with the cohesion funds.###this means putting forward the commission s priorities based on past experience in implementing the programmes as well as current community policies relating to structural operations.###the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use to the optimum and efficient use as some of you have wished of community involvement including mr bradbourn using if necessary the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monies.###when i speak of optimum utilisation i am referring both to the national and regional levels.###and so mr seppnen i shall also mention at this point speaking of the national level the link with the cohesion fund.###this is the purpose of these guidelines.###regarding their content as you know ladies and gentlemen of this house they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but at the same time very passionately as i understood her presentation just now.###the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create in all sectors but especially in the private sector as mr berend said the maximum number of serious worthwhile and permanent jobs the competitiveness of regional economies all regional economies and in particular mr evans that of wales but not only of wales.###and because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission let me also add the regional economies of the european regions handicapped by their distance from the centre be they remote regions island regions or of course the most remote regions which are naturally the most distant.###perhaps i may inform mr ribeiro e castro who asked me about this that as i wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions the commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.###concerning the most remote regions it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments but this is not necessarily an excuse just an explanation.###we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.###i myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 00 november and within the college we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions.###i would thank you for your understanding in this matter.###so that is the first priority the competitiveness of regional economies.###the second priority which several of you have stressed mr puerta in particular but there were others not that i am mentioning them in any order of priority is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.###ladies and gentlemen we now have a european union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great proving the effectiveness and worth of the cohesion fund but where at the same time in relation to unemployment  as you wrote mrs schroedter  an increasing gap exists between the 00 or 00 richest regions and the 00 or 00 poorest or most disadvantaged regions.###this is a situation which is as it should be unjustifiable and intolerable.###as far as i am concerned  taking into account my own concept of the construction of europe and regional development policy in particular  this is a situation which i find unacceptable and i have every intention as far as possible with your support of dedicating all the appropriations for which i am responsible to this improved social human and territorial cohesion particularly in order to prevent what i once called in this house a twospeed europe a europe of wealthy districts but at the same time a europe of impoverished areas.###the third objective is urban and rural development within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.###in fact the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account.###the first is rural development and let me say mrs schroedter that i am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport an issue i have been involved in personally for a long time.###i particularly remember the time when i was minister for the environment in my own country.###the second principle is that of equal opportunities particularly for men and women as well as the european strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary union.###finally and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this house particularly yourself mrs schroedter in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies for development or redevelopment which of all the priorities offer the maximum opportunity to synergy to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership.###you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership yet there is a clear reference to it on page 0 of the guidelines.###however i do wish to mention  since you have asked me to do so  that as far as i am concerned this partnership  and i spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely  is a tool one used to involve local brainpower be it in the public sector in the form of elected representatives the social and educational sectors associations or in the private sector a decentralised partnership and let me mention in this connection in response to mrs angelilli the territorial pacts which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.###these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities since they must be taken into consideration under each of the objectives to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the member states and regions.###i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made ladies and gentlemen and firstly on procedure.###it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date.###let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the commission in the form of a draft in february 0000 in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text my predecessor mrs wulfmathies presented them to parliament immediately.###due to the elections to the european parliament taking place around this time however parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted in july 0000.###here in this chamber ladies and gentlemen among you i wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning  mr hatzidakis asked me a question about this  as far as member states are concerned your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.###and let me assure you furthermore that when the commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the midterm review in mind in line with the regulations then the point of view of this house as expressed in this report will also be taken into account.###now to the form.###on the subject of the role of the guidelines mrs schroedter you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives often very precise ones should be provided.###i shall not list them all but they include implementing intersectoral policies increasing efficiency in the use of public funds assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together etc.###the commission takes note of these but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents such as the guide to the reform of the structural funds or the methodological working document.###drawing to a close i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated mrs schroedter.###i am thinking for example of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.###this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring s negotiations.###the commission kept to the actual text of article 00 of the structural funds regulations which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide member states with broad indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed community policies.###i actually quoted the text itself in quotation marks.###moreover the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.###you then mentioned mrs schroedter the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.###i find the opposite the case.###i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches and shall attach to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.###indeed i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere.###as regards rural development which a number of you brought up particularly mrs redondo jimnez the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas but also protection of the environment and europe s rural heritage.###it must however be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the structural funds whose objectives 0 and 0 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.###and indeed on the subject of the balance of rural society let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the eaggf guarantee section aimed at promoting reform in european agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.###at this stage i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective 0 rural areas in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective 0 regions.###in any event i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter.###before concluding i should like to tell mr savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck france austria and germany in particular in the last few weeks and at the same time we shall once again be discussing together with my fellow commissioner mrs de palacio what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of france.###i shall therefore reserve the right if you permit sir to give you my own opinion which to a great extent matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using objective 0.###i shall remind you that the commission is going to be approving the objective 0 zoning plans for france sweden austria and luxembourg tomorrow.###we shall then have an appropriate tool for working particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.###indeed this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.###in conclusion with thanks for your understanding mr president i should like to thank you mrs schroedter for the quality of your work and that of the committee and to tell you that i am very pleased apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines.###we have discussed this and i have attempted to clarify my point of view.###i am very pleased with the level of support offered by your house to the commission in establishing these guidelines which have been submitted to the member states for information when establishing their own programmes.###this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 00000000 programmes.###i feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions at this time when programming for the period 00000000 is being undertaken good joint working practice which is mr hatzidakis backed up by something i am very attentive to observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union###the next item is the debate on the report a000000000 by mr berend on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union sec000000  c0000000  00000000cos.###mr president commissioner barnier ladies and gentlemen the sixth periodic report contains a comprehensive and detailed description of the economic and social situation in the union s regions and of their development trends and represents as i see it a solid basis for the formulation of structural policy priorities at union level.###the report demonstrates that  measured in terms of gross domestic product per capita  the poorest regions are beginning to catch up and that is how the situation is set to continue.###this can largely be attributed to the structural funds even though the disparity between the poorest and wealthiest regions is still considerable.###employing european structural funds has already enabled convergence in standards of living.###over a ten year period the gap in average gdp has been reduced by ten percent.###this has particularly affected the four cohesion countries  in the positive sense of course  as it has the five former east german lnder.###unfortunately this europeanwide development was due in the main to an increase in productivity and only partly to an increase in the level of employment.###hence we would urge the commission and the member states to give due attention to the effect measures have on employment in future.###the lion s share of the transfer payments has been and still is used for investment in rationalisation and modernisation with the intention of improving labour productivity.###however this has dampened the effect of structural policy on employment.###this is not an assessment but for the moment merely an observation.###the report establishes however that regional differences in the labour market have in fact continued to increase.###unemployment is currently at 00 in 00 of the weakest regions.###ten years ago it was 0 lower i.e. 00.###and i might just mention that in the 00 best regions unemployment averages 0.0 it was 0.0 ten years ago hence there has been an increase of only 0.0.###the report makes clear the fact that 00 of unemployment is structural unemployment.###that is why  and this is the conclusion we can draw from this report  promoting competitiveness within industry and infrastructure for economic activity must be central to the structural policy in that order.###the corollary to this it has to be said is that measures for the retraining and ongoing training of the work force are of no small importance either.###in addition more attention must be given to boosting entrepreneurial potential in small and mediumsized enterprises and the services they call upon must be developed further.###another conclusion to be drawn from the report is that if financial support is to be utilised efficiently then the measures must be brought into line with the broadly diversified means of support intended to establish a middleclass and minimum standard of living.###a very important point to my mind.###in the conclusions of this report we make the commission aware that the legal bases for cooperation between regions and member states and applicant countries must be improved and point to how crucial it is for the budget to be consolidated as a prerequisite to the success of economic and monetary union and enlargement eastwards.###we call upon those member states that have not yet submitted a satisfactory map of development regions to do so immediately and of course we expect the commission to examine with due haste the operational programmes for the regions for the new support period 0000 to 0000 in the light of the results of the sixth periodic report and to do everything possible to enable this support period to commence without delay in those areas where it is needed and in the proper manner.###mr president commissioner this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.###i consider however that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in europe offers a somewhat oversimplified view of the situation and unfortunately this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.###the commission report generally relativises this observation particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the union in which i have a special interest by which i mean the french overseas departments and more generally the most remote regions.###in this respect i am pleased to see that the committee on regional policy transport and tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and more specifically to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new article 0000 of the treaty of amsterdam.###finally in my view this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of europe particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of europe and its more remote regions.###even if the commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the community area through the union s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the sec.###mr president the group of the party of european socialists in this parliament agrees with the report that mr berend has just presented and congratulates the author both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.###it must be remembered that currently the european union s overall competitiveness is in general terms 00 of that of the united states of america and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units that is the regions also improves.###furthermore this is at a time when technological development economic globalisation and our problems which are enlargement and the single currency demand that the regions as well as businesses and individuals make more of an effort to be competitive.###the european commission s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.###i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur one positive and one negative.###the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the union and that the community funds have been a major although not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities.###the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the european regions gdp and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.###it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.###this commissioner is the first commandment for the coming period.###thus mr president i ask my fellow members to approve this report and i ask the commission as other speakers have done to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 00000000.###mr president commissioner i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.###the sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the union s regional policy aims.###the report shows that growth has been uneven despite all our efforts.###very rapid growth is continuing in central europe.###the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general european average whereas many southern european and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.###we now require an indepth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.###is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences long distances climates that are too cold or too hot sparse populations and austere conditions.###how can the union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development.###it is also important to discover what the effects of union enlargement will be on structural funds and the development of the union s more remote areas.###the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility.###some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased.###this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.###in the future we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.###for example uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.###in this connection too weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development.###it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and knowhow.###our group is in favour of adopting this report.###mr president commissioner the european union s regional policy has until now not been able to interpret in any significant way the existing differences in our inhabitants incomes.###we have a serious situation in which in the european union today there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached on average 00.0 in the regions worst affected regions which also happen to be poor areas whilst in the 00 regions with the lowest unemployment corresponding to the richer areas unemployment stands at just 0.###given this situation the report approved by parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes which are often misspent with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the transeuropean rail networks which are due in 0000.###there should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries agriculture and fisheries which are often harmed by the european union s own insensitive policies as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs particularly for women and young people.###only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.###mr president commissioner mr berend s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the european commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.###the overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation boosting equality of opportunity increasing the sustainability of employment and development are only mentioned in passing.###this attitude appears to me to be unjustified.###i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.###this does not mean that i do not see the need for competitiveness particularly as i myself am an entrepreneur in an objective 0 region that is in brandenburg in the federal republic of germany and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and mediumsized enterprises.###it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the objective 0 regions that is to say job creation measures special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.###they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities.###supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development simply because there is no basis for a selfsupporting upturn in these objective 0 regions.###after all the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 0 in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.###concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demandorientated economic policy is not the answer.###and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and to a lesser extent in rationalisation.###it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demandorientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.###the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.###in other words what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.###for example these would be measures for vocational training for further education for reintegrating people who have already been excluded from the production process for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.###mr president my compliments to the rapporteur for his indepth report.###the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union.###by stimulating a diversity of investments the european union is endeavouring to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment.###from the sixth periodic report on the regions one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.###the efforts made in order to drive up the gdp per capita in objective 0 regions do not always result in such an increase not really a satisfying result over a period during which certainly over the past couple of years there has been economic growth.###as indicated by the rapporteur the effects of the structural measures on the other hand are minimal as far as employment is concerned.###some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for.###also the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.###mr president it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities especially in connection with boosting employment.###it is after all they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.###by allowing them to develop tailormade plans for the relevant regions and if necessary tying this in with financial aid a higher return can be achieved.###surely this must be the ultimate goal.###i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions.###following on from this it is probably also more meaningful with regard to the financial aid to regions to give member states more say anyway.###by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.###finally i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries.###the report shows that in general they are a long way behind eu countries especially in terms of gdp per capita.###with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy.###i would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.###mr president commissioner following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.###for example whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased there has been a certain amount of convergence between the member states themselves in this respect.###equally unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all indeed they rose in some cases.###i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.###even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.###since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout europe to reduce unemployment then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.###genuine structural reforms and a competitionfriendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.###if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a costintensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.###we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.###mr president commissioner my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.###this issue which has an impact on their everyday life is a key issue as regards eu credibility.###it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided i would say quite magnificently the development of poor countries.###i remember what portugal and greece used to be like when i drove through those countries for the first time twentyfive years ago.###in this connection french speakers would speak of a coup de chapeau  in other words i take my hat off to the eu.###the eu really deserves such a gesture but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.###what is the result.###people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.###consequently we have to build schools hospitals and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.###this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.###most people however would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised if they were given the chance to in other words if there was work there.###we must give them this opportunity.###this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have.###the solution as i see it lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.###by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business but creating will.###i mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life whether he or she is an employee the owner of a business or an official.###what is a fair society.###one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.###in this way positive development of the regions is also possible because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.###finally i would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from america where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy as it often is here in europe.###mr president commissioner as my time is limited i shall get straight to the point.###firstly let me make a statement of fact the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the union.###the most remote regions still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates offer one example of this.###in reunion for example the rate is 00.###this is not a situation related to the economic climate however rather it is a structural problem created by our remoteness our insularity in short our own specific personality.###the principle of specific exceptional treatment was envisaged in article 0000 of the treaty of amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.###it only remains to put this principle into practice.###the commission document expected to be ready in december 0000 was delayed until january then february and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.###i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission.###as regards taxation state aid the structural funds and defending our traditional products practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.###if these do not materialise then unfortunately convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions despite the size of the amounts committed will end in failure.###mr president as all the previous speakers have done i should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.###just like the previous report this extremely competent and precise analysis the recommendations it supports and your own comments ladies and gentlemen shall prove useful to the commission in general and to the commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 00000000.###i should also like to make a few comments firstly mr berend regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.###you pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote if i am not mistaken that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.###on behalf of all the officials of the commission and my predecessor mrs wulfmathies i must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this house and by yourself.###the commission was certainly very anxious to ensure mr berend that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.###i am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 0.0 of this report where the commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported improved and influenced by factors which some of you  mr markov just now and mrs raschhofer  stressed very forcefully.###i am thinking of technological research and development infrastructure provision and quality human resources potential small and mediumsized businesses and direct investment from abroad.###so much for the quality.###i do not wish to spend time right now mr berend going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed.###let me just itemise them the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the member states.###secondly partnership a subject which a number of you stressed the role of local and regional authorities the private sector both sides of industry associations and local community action groups.###regarding this problem of partnership i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly.###thirdly the need to develop the employment side of growth even though i am aware as mr van dam just said that the prime responsibility is that of the member states and that when we speak of the responsibility of member states and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.###mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.###mr fruteau we at least need to recognise that there is growth and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession as has been the case in the past.###you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.###i agree with your analysis.###when there is growth it must be better distributed but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness be they the most remote or island regions is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.###fourthly a point which mrs hedkvist petersen stressed just now the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.###fifthly the importance and role of small and mediumsized businesses.###mr vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.###finally the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the structural funds the motives of officials in managing these funds even if it is occasionally complicated and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation followup and supervision of the commission.###in relation to this i must inform the european parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 0000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of structural funds.###i should like to mention a few specific points.###mr berend you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.###well we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.###tomorrow the commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon i hope it will be italy s turn.###you may therefore be satisfied on this point since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 0.###regarding the informal economy you mention in your report i am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and as mr cocilovo mentioned there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.###to a certain extent they are taken into account in the statistics on gdp and labour force surveys and in any case i wish to point out the efforts which eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.###mr berend you also mentioned as did mr aparicio snchez the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.###on this point which is of personal interest to me let me remind you that the small scale of this sector  and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area  and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.###this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries under commissioner fischler.###nonetheless i must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which no doubt will respond better to these concerns.###several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.###i wish to assure you firstly that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is as far as i am concerned mr berend an extremely important instrument not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of europe and furthermore with the elected representatives i.e. yourselves on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a european regional planning policy.###in any event i have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report the definition compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of central and eastern europe a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned particularly mrs sudre and mr fruteau analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of central and eastern europe.###this will constitute a great challenge to us all for you and for the commission in the next few years.###and finally there are the crossborder aspects.###i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.###finally i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are in any case familiar with but whose main elements i should like to reiterate.###ladies and gentlemen considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence particularly for the four cohesion countries but also frankly mr pohjamo for the objective 0 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development especially regarding infrastructure.###this is my first point regarding the policy.###my second point regarding the policy is as follows the structural funds have made and continue to make a significant contribution to the convergence process.###all the macroeconomic models we are working on show that over the last decade more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the structural funds.###i have however taken note particularly with regard to the most remote regions mrs sudre mr fruteau and mr nogueira romn too that your observation is that there is still much to do  and this is my third point regarding the policy  in terms of improving employment takeup aspects the fight against social exclusion which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.###now to my fourth point regarding the policy enlargement of the union the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions the major challenge too for the european policy on cohesion a point which mr van dam highlighted.###i shall say that something is already taking shape in berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.###i am thinking in particular of the preaccession structural instrument which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.###you see ladies and gentlemen we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the union s enlargement on our structural policy.###this sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole mr berend is a good basis for our thinking for us all and for myself.###i should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 00000000.###thank you very much commissioner.###the debate is closed.###the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 p.m.###the sitting was closed at 0.00 p.m.###adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting###the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed.###are there any comments.###mr president i respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the minutes.###i refer to item 00 on the order of business.###firstly i believe the issue raised by the president of the socialist group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the president of the commission on the fiveyear strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.###i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group.###the second point i would like to make  and which i would have wished to make yesterday before the vote  is that this parliament as other speakers remarked yesterday can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the european commission.###we should also have the humility to recognise that if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the president of the commission but also by a fiveyear programme we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this house so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the commission what our wishes were.###there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this.###when there are major setpiece debates scheduled between this house and the european commission in the future we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.###there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission.###we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.###looking at some of the press reports of last friday i believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable selfrestraint in the way they commented publicly.###that is something for which i have a deep appreciation.###i hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which i believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.###it should not be dramatised into something more than that.###thank you very much mr cox.###i understand what you are saying.###we have taken note of this.###mr president concerning item 00 of the minutes on the order of business we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on todays agenda.###however it was withdrawn from the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.###it therefore needs to be withdrawn from todays agenda.###mr wynn that makes sense.###the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.###mr president regarding mrs lynnes comments yesterday about health and safety in this building i presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the tower.###this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.###i do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly but this is a serious problem.###mrs ahern we have taken note of this.###i would ask you to bring this specific case which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor to the attention of the quaestors who are in fact responsible for the matter.###we will also pass this on to our services however.###thank you very much.###the minutes were approved###reform of european competition policy###the next item is the joint debate on the following reports###a000000000 by mr von wogau on behalf of the committee on

commission s white paper on modernisation of the european competition rules has ignited intense and lively debate amongst interested members of the public.###the reactions from experts and persons affected range from complete rejection to unconditional support.###what is this white paper in fact about.###the existing system of european competition rules was set up in the early years of the community.###this system which is based on a centralised application and approvals procedure was certainly appropriate for the conditions prevailing at the time.###this procedure made a substantial contribution to the development of a european competition culture.###however the framework conditions have fundamentally changed in the 00 years since it came into being.###the community of 0 has enlarged to one of 00 and is set to undergo further enlargement to encompass 00 members.###but the system has hardly changed at all.###that is why there is an urgent need for reform and no one takes issue with this in debate.###nevertheless certain critics are of the opinion that the commission s proposals go too far.###the commission wants to abolish the application and approvals procedure and enhance the role of national authorities and courts in the implementation of the competition rules.###in other words this would mean a transition from an authorisation system to one of legal exemption.###however the prohibition principle and this is important is to be retained.###in principle i take the view that we ought when an authority accused of tending towards bureaucracy and centralism submits a proposal for debureaucratisation and decentralisation to at least give this serious consideration.###according to the commissions proposal it all revolves around competitioninhibiting agreements between enterprises and abuses of powerful positions.###however the notification obligation with respect to state aid and corporate concentrations is to be retained.###the committee on economic and monetary affairs gave its blessing in principle to these proposals put forward by the commission with only one vote against and two abstentions.###however it will only be possible to form a conclusive assessment once the currently awaited bills produced by the commission are published.###whilst i may endorse the commission s proposals in principle still there are a number of points that warrant improvement or at least clarification.###i would like to go into some of these points briefly.###many critics of the white paper maintain that decentralisation will jeopardise the consistent application of community legislation.###not all national authorities in particular the courts are in a position as yet to fulfil the role the commission has in mind for them when it comes to the application of the competition rules.###firstly in the course of the last few decades the national monopolies have familiarised themselves with the implementation of the competition rules to an adequate degree.###secondly the national courts will be empowered to implement articles 00 0 00 and 00 in accordance with the current administration of justice.###nonetheless it is still extremely important for the commission to support the national authorities and courts with group exemption regulations guidelines and notices.###furthermore cooperation between the national authorities and the commission as well as amongst the national authorities themselves must be strengthened.###as far as the competence of the national courts is concerned we recommend in this report that specialised courts be set up for dealing with monopolies law proceedings.###these are already in existence in certain member states and they have proved successful.###entrepreneurs for their part fear a loss of legal certainty.###in order to guard against this the enterprises should in certain cases continue to have the opportunity of being given prior clarification by the commission.###these are only a few albeit central aspects that must be taken into account where the modernisation of the european competition rules is concerned.###that said the process is still very much in its infancy.###discussion will continue until such time as legislative proposals are eventually produced.###however i am convinced of the fact that the white paper has put us on the right path.###a european competition culture has come into being in the course of the last few decades.###the decentralisation proposed by the commission accords with the principle of subsidiarity which has in fact now been firmly established in the treaty.###this leads to increased implementation of the european competition rules at national and regional level thereby making it possible for the european competition culture to be placed on a broader basis.###finally i would like to say that the competition policy reform we are introducing here is a necessity and that it is going to be absolutely necessary in this context to clarify that the european union s competition policy is an essential prerequisite to the success of a social market economy.###both the commission and parliament must do more than they have done hitherto to get the message across that competition policy competition between enterprises and the fact that the european commission is supervising this are first and foremost matters which have the interests of the citizens at heart.###mr president commissioner today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union s competition policy.###we are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for european monopolies law that is mr von wogau s report and it is far more controversial than the vote in the committee on economic and monetary affairs may have given us reason to believe.###i want to make it quite clear that in this specific case i personally consider the commission s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term modernisation to describe the content of articles 00 and 00 of the white paper or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression retrograde step .###however we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 0000 and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.###but of course both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper.###it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy.###on reading both commission documents one learns that 0000 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 0000 were pursued and even partially completed which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.###allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture.###as the competent authority the commission with its logically consistent approach has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition not always to the delight of the member states or enterprises concerned.###it should continue along this path.###but commissioner none of this is to become less complicated in future  one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the union the deepening of the internal market technological progress globalisation.###indeed it is not just about modernisation of community law more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions for the european competition policy will be dependent on the population s acceptance together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.###only without transparency there will be no acceptance indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.###the competition report 0000 is not a bad foundation for this but in fact there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.#
